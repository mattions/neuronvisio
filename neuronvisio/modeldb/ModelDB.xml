This collection of files can be used to reproduce the modeling results in:

K.P. Carlin, K.E. Jones, Z. Jiang, L.M. Jordan and R.M. Brownstone
Dendritic L-type calcium currents in mouse spinal motoneurons: implications for bistability.
European Journal of Neuroscience, Vol. 12, pp. 1635-1646, 2000

The parameters for the ion channels were adapted from:

V. Booth, J. Rinzel and O. Kiehn
Compartmental model of vertebrate motoneurons for Ca2+-dependent spiking and plateau potentials
under pharmacological treatment.
Journal of Neurophysiology, Vol. 78, pp. 3371-3385, 1997

The files are meant to reproduce the results illustrated in Figure 3 of Carlin et al. (2000).

The file fig_3aleft.hoc will produce the left panel of fig3a.  The file fig_3aright.hoc
needs to have the the fig_3aleft.hoc file run first.  These files produces approximations
to the figures in the paper.  If higher numerical resolution is desired the time step
can be decreased to 0.025 ms but of course this will take longer to calculate the figures.

If it is desired to indiviually generate these panels the following procedure may be followed:
In order to reproduce the various panels of the figure some editing will be needed.
All editing can be done in the file 'init.hoc' on the lines 11 &amp; 17.
Line 11 opens the file describing the membrane mechanisms in the model, of which there are 7:

memb_N_soma.hoc, memb_N_dend.hoc, memb_LLVA_soma.hoc, memb_LLVA_dend.hoc, memb_LHVA_soma.hoc,
memb_LHVA_dend.hoc &amp; memb_Lboth.hoc

Line 17 opens a session file for performing two types of experiments illustrated:

voltage_step.ses	//for doing the voltage step experiments of Fig 3A
ramp.ses		//for doing the ramp voltage clamp exp's of Figs 3B,C

In order to reproduce Fig 3A top, left panel (N type Ca2+ channels in soma):
Line 11= xopen(&quot;memb_N_soma.hoc&quot;)
Line 17= xopen(&quot;voltage_step.ses&quot;)

Fig 3A top, right panel (N type Ca2+ channels in dendrites):
Line 11= xopen(&quot;memb_N_dend.hoc&quot;)
Line 17= xopen(&quot;voltage_step.ses&quot;)


Prior to running the voltage_step.ses simulations:
1) Turn on 'Keep Lines' in the two Graph windows by right clicking and selecting *Keep Lines*
2) Click on VClamp in the PointProcess window and check the amplitude of the Testing Level.
   It can be left at -51 mV or depolarized to skip voltage test levels. Leave it odd though
   if you want to have figures like those publised.
3) Click on VClamp Family in the PointProcess window and make sure that there are about
   20 steps with a resolution of 2 mV/step.
4) Click on Quiet to suppress continuous drawing since these simulations take some time.
5) Click on Vary Test level in the PointProcess window to start the simulations.

On my machine with currents in the soma, the 700 ms voltage clamp protocol takes 17 sec Real Time.
With currents in the dendrites the same protocol takes 77 sec Real Time.

*/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// NOTE: The paper reports the currents as current density. This was done so that we could
// constrain the simulation to the experimental data. The model has an estimated capacitance
// of 8.4 nF using the same protocol as we used experimentally. The peak current density
// experimentally was 8.7 pA/pF where the capacitance of the cells was measured by integrating
// the current transient during a -10 mV, 50 ms voltage step and dividing by 10 mV.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/


In order to reproduce Fig 3Bi (L_LVA type Ca2+ channels in soma):
Line 11= xopen(&quot;memb_LLVA_soma.hoc&quot;)
Line 17= xopen(&quot;ramp.ses&quot;)

Fig 3Bii (L_LVA type Ca2+ channels in dendrites):
Line 11= xopen(&quot;memb_LLVA_dend.hoc&quot;)
Line 17= xopen(&quot;ramp.ses&quot;)

Prior to running the ramp.ses simulations:
1) You will probably want to select Quiet to suppress the graph drawing to speed things up.
2) Check the parameters of the PointProcess by selecting R_VClamp: dur= 100, 20000, 100; amp= -120, -180, -120
3) Click on Init &amp; Run and away you go.

On my machine these simulations with dendritic currents take &amp;gt;1800 sec (30 min). You don't get the I-V curve in
the paper but you can save the data and plot it that way if you like.

   A component of recorded currents demonstrated kinetics consistent with a current originating at a site spatially segregated from the soma. In response to step commands this component was seen as a late-onset, low amplitude persistent current whilst in response to depolarizing-repolarizing ramp commands a low voltage clockwise current hysteresis was recorded. Simulations using a neuromorphic motoneuron model could reproduce these currents only if a noninactivating calcium conductance was placed in the dendritic compartments.Reference: Carlin KP, Jones KE, Jiang Z, Jordan LM, Brownstone RM (2000) Dendritic L-type calcium currents in mouse spinal motoneurons: implications for bistability.

   &lt;pre&gt;    This model was published in E.E. Saftenku &quot;A simplified model of
    the long-term plasticity in cerebellar mossy fiber-granule cell
    synapses&quot;, Neurophysiology/Neirofiziologiya, 2002, 34, N 2-3, P.216-219.

    Activation of cerebellar mossy fibers using either a theta burst 
    stimulation mode (TBS; 100 Hz for 100 ms repeated 4 times at 250
    ms intervals) or a single tetanus stimulation train (100 Hz for 
    1 s) results in long-term potentiation (LTP) of both AMPA and 
    NMDA components of EPSC in granule cells, whereas low-frequency 
    stimulation (2 Hz) causes long-term depression. These forms of 
    plasticity require Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptor channels. 
    When about two synapses were initially activated by TBS, the 
    amplitude of evoked EPSPs exceeded the control value by 70+-16%
    in 1 min and then continued to slowly increase reaching in 7 min
    an increment of 84+-16%. We modified a simple model for LTP/LTD 
    developed by Migliore and Lansky (1999) and combined it with the
    model of the electrical activity in the cerebellar granule cells
    developed by D'Angelo et al (Bursting and resonance in cerebellar
    granule cells by D&amp;rsquo;Angelo et al., 2001 in ModelDB)with addition 
    of the description of AMPA and NMDA receptor kinetics. In 
    contrast to the model of Migliore and Lansky, an activation of
    autocatalytic processes is controlled not by postsynaptic 
    depolarization, but by Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptor 
    channels. The model completely reproduces experimental conditions
    and results of LTP manifestation in the presence of bicuculline
    and short-term depression of AMPA EPSPs during TBS published in
    Armano S. et al. &quot;Long-term potentiation of intrinsic 
    excitability at the mossy fiber-granule cell synapse of rat 
    cerebellum&quot;, J. Neurosci., 2000, 20, P. 5208-5216. The 
    observed nonlinearity in the development of long-term changes of 
    EPSP in granule cells was modeled by a difference in the rate 
    constants of two independent autocatalytic processes. The model 
    can be easily modified for presynaptic expression of LTP by 
    multiplying freqdel*(Np-Nd) by variable  &quot;u&quot; instead of synaptic
    conductances.

The transmitter concentration profile in the cleft was described by 
three exponential components to reproduce the profile of glutamate 
concentration from Rusakov (2001). Neurotransmitter concentration was
made proportional to release probability of glutamate on the APs. 
Short-term plasticity was modeled with the use of phenomenological
model of  Tsodyks and Markram, but  release probability in the model
corresponds not to xu, but to x(u/U)*weight in their designations, 
where &quot;weight&quot; can be considered as the probability to release on the
first AP. This allowed us to reproduce slower decrease of release 
probability during repetitive stimulation, which occurs presumably 
due to several vesicles in the ready-to-release pool under condition
of one-vesicle constraint. 

Keywords: Cerebellar granule cells, Long-term plasticity.

Simulations.
      Begin from start.hoc and reproduce the maintenance of LTP and 
      LTD as in Fig.1 from our paper. All parameters of the model 
      can be changed in the respective boxes.

   We simulated synaptic transmission and modified a simple model of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in order to describe long-term plasticity related changes in cerebellar mossy fiber-granule cell synapses. In our model, protein autophosphorylation, leading to the maintenance of long-term plasticity, is controlled by Ca2+ entry through the NMDA receptor channels. The observed nonlinearity in the development of long-term changes of EPSP in granule cells is explained by the difference in the rate constants of two independent autocatalytic processes.

The bfstdp_demo.hoc (which runs on Auto-launch) runs the learning procedure for
10000 s (about 3 hours) and displays the weight matrix from Input to Output
layers together with the time-evolution of three of the weights.

The simulation takes 20 minutes or so, but you should be able to see the weight
patterns begin to form, as in Figure 2 of the J. Neurosci. paper, before this
time.

Data files are produced in a subdirectory called Data, and may be plotted using
Matlab, Gnuplot (use pm3d in map view), etc.  A sample graphing program,
bfstdp_many.gnu, is provided but must be modified by globally changing the date
and time from 20071217_1201 to the time recorded in the filenames in the Data
directory.  When you run the file in linux with the command
&quot;gnuplot bfstdp_many.gnu&quot; it will then produce a postscript file that looks similar to:

  <description>
   A common problem in tasks involving the integration of spatial information from multiple senses, or in sensorimotor coordination, is that different modalities represent space in different frames of reference. Coordinate transformations between different reference frames are therefore required. One way to achieve this relies on the encoding of spatial information using population codes. The set of network responses to stimuli in different locations (tuning curves) constitute a basis set of functions which can be combined
linearly through weighted synaptic connections in order to approximate non-linear transformations of the input variables. The question then arises how the appropriate synaptic connectivity is obtained. 

This model shows that a network of spiking neurons can learn the coordinate transformation from one frame of reference to another, with connectivity that develops continuously in an unsupervised manner, based only on the correlations available in the environment, and with a biologically-realistic plasticity mechanism (spike timing-dependent plasticity).Reference: Davison AP, Fregnac Y (2006) Learning Cross-Modal Spatial Transformations through Spike Timing-Dependent

This is a readme for a model associated with the paper:

current affects resting potential and response to depolarization in
simulated spinal sensory neurons. J Neurophysiol
86:1351-64

Abstract:

Small dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which include nociceptors,
express multiple voltage-gated sodium currents. In addition to a
classical fast inactivating tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) sodium
current, many of these cells express a TTX-resistant (TTX-R) sodium
current that activates near -70 mV and is persistent at negative
potentials. To investigate the possible contributions of this TTX-R
persistent (TTX-RP) current to neuronal excitability, we carried out
computer simulations using the Neuron program with TTX-S and -RP
currents, fit by the Hodgkin-Huxley model, that closely matched the
currents recorded from small DRG neurons. In contrast to fast TTX-S
current, which was well fit using a m(3)h model, the persistent TTX-R
current was not well fit by an m(3)h model and was better fit using an
mh model. The persistent TTX-R current had a strong influence on
resting potential, shifting it from -70 to -49.1 mV. Inclusion of an
ultra-slow inactivation gate in the persistent current model reduced
the potential shift only slightly, to -56.6 mV. The persistent TTX-R
current also enhanced the response to depolarizing inputs that were
subthreshold for spike electrogenesis. In addition, the presence of
persistent TTX-R current predisposed the cell to anode break
excitation. These results suggest that, while the persistent TTX-R
current is not a major contributor to the rapid depolarizing phase of
the action potential, it contributes to setting the electrogenic
properties of small DRG neurons by modulating their resting potentials
and response to subthreshold stimuli.

Note: These NEURON files were created by Tom Morse.

Usage:

Simply auto-launching from ModelDB will cause a panel of buttons to pop
up where the Figure 2 button will create a picture similar to fig 2
in the paper:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=86537&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\herzogEtAl01\.\fig2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fig2&quot; /&gt;

Similarly for the figure 4 button:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=86537&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\herzogEtAl01\.\fig4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fig4&quot; /&gt;

Alternatively you can:

1) download and extract the files.
2) Compile the mod files as usual on your platform (run mknrndll under
windows, execute nrnivmodl in the extracted directory under linux, or 
drag and drop the extracted folder onto the mknrndll icon under mac os x).
3) Then start mosinit.hoc (double click on mosinit.hoc in windows, type 
&quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot; in linux, or drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file
onto the nrngui icon in mac os x). The above described figure buttons
are created.

April 28th, 2009 Bug fixes in KDR supplied by Tom Andersson.  The
reversal potential and the ninf in KDR were corrected to those in the 
paper.  Also Andersson suggested using the leak conductance value given
in the paper (the one corresponding to 300 MOhm can also be used with
a trivial difference in results).  The paper value was implemented.

   1) J Cogn Neurosci: 3 structural mechanisms that had been hypothesized to underlie vsWM development during childhood were evaluated by simulating the model and comparing results to fMRI. It was concluded that inter-regional synaptic connection strength cause vsWM development.

2) J Integr Neurosci: Given the importance of fronto-parietal connections, we tested whether connection asymmetry affected resistance to distraction. We drew the conclusion that stronger frontal connections are benefiction. By comparing model results to EEG, we concluded that the brain indeed has stronger frontal-to-parietal connections than vice versa.Reference: Edin F, Macoveanu J, Olesen P, Tegner J, Klingberg T (2007) Stronger synaptic connectivity as a mechanism behind development of working memory-related brain activity during childhood.

Learning mechanism for column formation in the olfactory bulb
by M. Migliore, Carlo Inzirillo, Gordon M. Shepherd, 
Front. Integr. Neurosci. (2007) 1:12. doi:10.3389/neuro.07.012.2007

In the olfactory bulb, the processing units for odor discrimination
are believed to involve dendrodendritic synaptic interactions between
mitral and granule cells.  There is increasing anatomical evidence
that these cells are organized in columns, and that the columns
processing a given odor are arranged in widely distributed arrays.
Experimental evidence is lacking on the underlying learning mechanisms
for how these columns and arrays are formed.  We have used a
simplified realistic circuit model to test the hypothesis that
distributed connectivity can self-organize through an
activity-dependent dendrodendritic synaptic mechanism.  The results
point to action potentials propagating in the mitral cell lateral
dendrites as playing a critical role in this mechanism, and suggest a
novel and robust learning mechanism for the development of distributed
processing units in a cortical structure.

The traces shown in Fig.2 of the paper are produced by running
2mc-w05-w00-e2i3-int220.hoc.  However, because the simulation is quite
long, the output files are included in the distribution and read by
plasticity-disp.hoc, that also allows the display of the time course
for all dendrodendritic synapses.

After the fig 2 button is pressed and the simulations have completed,
the windows can have there axes adjusted similarly to the figures:

Kondgen H, Geisler C, Fusi S, Wang XJ, Luscher HR, Giugliano M (2008)
The dynamical response properties of neocortical neurons to temporally
modulated noisy inputs in vitro. Cereb Cortex 18:2086-9

Neocortical neurons are classified by their current-frequency
relationships. This is a static description and it may be inadequate
to interpret neuronal responses to time-varying stimuli.

Theoretical studies (Brunel et al., 2001; Fourcaud-Trocme et al. 2003;
Fourcaud-Trocme and Brunel 2005; Naundorf et al. 2005) suggested that
single-cell dynamical response properties are necessary to interpret
ensemble responses to fast input transients. Further, it was shown
that input-noise linearizes and boosts the response bandwidth, and
that the interplay between the barrage of noisy synaptic currents and
the spike-initiation mechanisms determine the dynamical properties of
the firing rate.

In order to allow a reader to explore such simulations, we prepared a
simple NEURON implementation of the experiments performed in Kondgen
et al., 2008 (see also Fourcaud-Trocme al. 2003; Fourcaud-Trocme and
Brunel 2005).

In addition, we provide sample MATLAB routines for exploring the
sandwich model proposed in Kondgen et al., 2008, employing a simple
frequdency-domain filtering.

The simulations and the MATLAB routines are based on the linear
response properties of layer 5 pyramidal cells estimated by injecting
a superposition of a small-amplitude sinusoidal wave and a background
noise, as in Kondgen et al., 2008.  Similarly to the experiments
performed there, the simulations quantify the evoked firing
probability across many stimulation trials and a wide range of
oscillation frequencies (1-1000 Hz). The (dynamical) response is
quantified in terms of amplitude and phase-shift, while changing noise
statistics.

Neocortical neurons track unexpectedly fast transients, as their
response amplitude has no attenuation up to 200 Hz. This cut-off
frequency is higher than the limits set by passive membrane properties
(~50 Hz) and average firing rate (~20 Hz) and is not affected by the
rate of change of the input.

These model files were supplied by Michele Giugliano.

A short demo has been created by 
Michele Giugliano &amp; Vincent Delattre
Brain Mind Institute, EPFL of Lausanne
Demonstrating: 1) noisy stimulation, modulated in time
               2) instantaneous firing rate, estimate and quantitative fit

The demo uses a single-compartmental, conductance-based model neuron
in a current-clamp stimulation.  Each spike is counted and has it's
time recorded, then the output firing rate is graphically compared
with the input. When started (Click the run button) the simulation
produces the following graphs of spikes and injected current

   Neocortical neurons are classified by current&amp;ndash;frequency relationship. This is a static description and it may be inadequate to interpret neuronal responses to time-varying stimuli. 

Theoretical studies (Brunel et al., 2001; Fourcaud-Trocmé et al. 2003; Fourcaud-Trocmé and Brunel 2005; Naundorf et al. 2005) suggested that single-cell dynamical response properties are necessary to interpret ensemble responses to fast input transients. Further, it was shown that input-noise linearizes and boosts the response bandwidth, and that the interplay between the barrage of noisy synaptic currents and the spike-initiation mechanisms determine the dynamical properties of the firing rate. 

In order to allow a reader to explore such simulations, we prepared a simple NEURON implementation of the experiments performed in Köndgen et al., 2008 (see also Fourcaud-Trocmé al. 2003; Fourcaud-Trocmé and Brunel 2005).

In addition, we provide sample MATLAB routines for exploring the sandwich model proposed in Köndgen et al., 2008, employing a simple frequdency-domain filtering.

The simulations and the MATLAB routines are based on the linear response properties of layer 5 pyramidal cells estimated by injecting a superposition of a small-amplitude sinusoidal wave and a background noise, as in Köndgen et al., 2008.References: 1.

Prescott SA, De Koninck Y. (2005) Integration time in a subset of
spinal lamina I neurons is lengthened by sodium and calcium currents
acting synergistically to prolong subthreshold depolarization. 
J Neurosci. 25(19):4743-54. 

Abstract:
Lamina I of the spinal dorsal horn plays an important role in 
processing and relaying nociceptive information to the brain. 
It comprises physiologically distinct cell types that process 
information in fundamentally different ways: tonic neurons fire 
repetitively during stimulation and display prolonged EPSPs, 
suggesting operation as integrators, whereas single-spike neurons
act like coincidence detectors. Using whole-cell recordings from a 
rat spinal slice preparation,weset out to determine the basis for 
prolonged EPSPs in tonic cells and the implications for signal 
processing. Kinetics of synaptic currents could not explain 
differences in EPSP kinetics. Instead, tonic neurons were found to 
express a persistent sodium current, INa,P , that amplified and 
prolonged depolarization in response to brief stimulation. Tonic 
neurons also expressed a persistent calcium current, ICa,P , that 
contributed to prolongation but not to amplification. Simulations
using NEURON software demonstrated that INa,P was necessary and 
sufficient to explain amplification, whereas INa,P and ICa,P acted
synergistically to prolong depolarization: initial activation of the
slower current (ICa,P) depended on the faster current (INa,P) but
maintained activation of the faster current likewise depended on the
slower current. Additional investigation revealed that INa,P and 
ICa,P could dramatically increase integration time (&amp;gt;30X) and 
thereby encourage temporal summation but at the expense of spike 
time precision. Thus, by prolonging subthreshold depolarization, 
intrinsic inward currents allow tonic neurons in spinal lamina I
to specialize as integrators that are optimally suited to encode
stimulus intensity.

Model Notes:
Model demonstrates mechanism whereby two kinetically distinct 
inward currents act synergistically to prolong subthreshold 
depolarization.  The important currents are a persistent Na current
(with fast kinetics) and a persistent Ca current (with slower 
kinetics).  Model also includes a slow K current and transient Ca 
current, in addition to standard HH currents.  Model parameters are
set to values used in Fig. 8A.  Simulation shows prolonged 
depolarizations in response to two brief stimuli.

Usage:
Auto-launch from ModelDB (unix and pc).  Press init and run()
button.

Alternatively download the zip archive. Then depending on your platform:

mswin:
Expand the archive.  Run mknrndll and traverse to the newly created
directory and click make the nrnmech.dll
Then double click the mosinit.hoc file in windows explorer.

Unix:
Expand the archive with 
unzip *.zip
Compile the NEURON mod files by running nrnivmodl in the newly created directory.  
Type 
nrngui mosinit.hoc
to start the simulation

mac OS X.

Drag and drop the zip file on the mos2nrn icon in the Neuron application folder.
The mod files are automatically compiled and the simulation starts automatically.

---

Note:  The voltage-gated mechanisms have been revised to allow 
adaptive integration, rather than fixed time step integration 
with dt = 0.01 ms as was done in the paper.  This allows the 
simulation to run faster without loss of accuracy.  Also, the 
initial membrane potential has been changed from -63 to -62.65 mV, 
which is the resting potential for this particular model 
implementation.

     Synaptic conductances are influenced markedly by the geometry
     of the space surrounding the synapse since the transient 
     glutamate concentration in the synaptic cleft is determined by 
     this geometry. In our paper we attempted to understand the 
     reasons for slow glutamate diffusion in the cerebellar 
     glomerulus, a structure situated around the enlarged mossy fiber
     terminal in the cerebellum and surrounded by a glial sheath. 
     For this purpose, analytical expressions for glutamate diffusion
     in the glomerulus were considered in the models with two-(2D), 
     three- (3D), and fractional two-three dimensional (2D-3D) 
     geometry with an absorbing boundary. The time course of average
     glutamate concentration in the synaptic cleft of the mossy 
     fiber-granule cell connection was calculated for both direct 
     release of glutamate from the synaptic unit, and for cumulative
     spillover of glutamate from neighboring release sites. Several
     kinetic schemes were examined, and the parameters of the 
     diffusion models were estimated by identifying theoretical 
     activation of AMPA receptors with direct release and spillover 
     components of published experimental AMPA receptor-mediated 
     EPSCs (DiGregorio, Nusser, Silver, 2002). We assumed that  
     anomalous diffusion of glutamate occurs in the glomerulus. Our
     assumption was confirmed by a good fit and match of experimental
     estimations and theoretical parameters, obtained in the 
     simulations that use an approximation of anomalous diffusion by
     a solution for fractional Brownian motion.

Keywords: Glutamate diffusion, Cerebellar granule cells, Spillover.

Simulations.
    Begin from mosinit.hoc. 
    Clicking on buttons, you can choose the models with absorbing 
    boundary, closed boundary or without boundary. For each model you
    can choose the simulation of glutamate diffusion in the 
    environment with 2D, 3D or 2D-3D geometry and compute direct 
    release and spillover components of AMPAR activation as in our 
    Fig. 7. Only simple 3-state kinetic schemes of AMPARs with rate 
    constants extracted from receptor kinetics during exposure of 
    definite glutamate concentrations to outside-out patches from 
    cultured granule cells are used in our examples. Clicking on 
    button &quot;Fractional Brownian motion&quot; you can simulate anomalous 
    glutamate diffusion in the model with absorbing boundary 
    (Fig. 12a,b). Clicking on &quot;Direct summation of glutamate&quot;, you 
    can reproduce four possible combinations of direct release and 
    spillover AMPAR-mediated EPSCs (Fig. 10). These EPSCs are evoked
    by two consecutive stimuli with time interval 10 ms and can be 
    observed under assumption of 2 vesicles in the ready-release pool
    and the hypothesis of one vesicle release per AP. The density of 
    active release sites is calculated in accordance with changes of 
    release probability at each AP. If there is only one vesicle in 
    the pool, then Markram and Tsodyks model for determination of 
    release probability can be used. The use of the calculated 
    release probability in the expression for ionic current will give
    incorrect result as such a kind of modeling assumes that AMPARs 
    are desensitized to such an extent for the second AP as if all 
    release sites had released vesicles on the first AP.  In reality
    not more than P1*100% synaptic units can be desensitized by a 
    direct release of glutamate, but synaptic units are desensitized
    to a lesser extent by spillover glutamate. All parameters of the
    model can be changed in the respective boxes.

The fig6.hoc simulation file will show the membrane potential
in a distal dendrite (350um from soma) for three simulations,
as in Fig.6 of the paper.
In each case two APs are elicited, unpaired with EPSPs
or paired with EPSPs after a 35 or 45ms delay.
The simulations show that the APs in the dendrites are boosted
only when they are paired with coincident EPSPs. 

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui fig6.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file

This is the readme for the model published in 

Kampa &amp; Stuart (2006) Calcium spikes in basal dendrites of layer 5
pyramidal neurons during action potential bursts. 
J Neurosci 26(28):7424-32.

The simulation creates two plots showing voltage and calcium changes
in basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons during action
potential (AP) backpropagation.  Running after selecting 1 AP leads
to (after zooming in on the Ca2+ plot):

Usage:

Autolaunch from ModelDB **or** download and extract the archive and
then compile the mod files in the mod directory and run under ...

linux/unix
----------
by typing
nrnivmodl mod
in the top level directory.  Then type
nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin
-------

by running mknrndll, cd'ing to the mod directory and press make
nrnmech.dll button.  Copy the nrnmech.dll file to the parent directory
of the mod folder (the top-level directory).  Double click on the
mosinit.hoc file.

MAC OS X
--------

drag and drop the mod folder onto mknrndll icon in the NEURON
application folder.  Start a terminal window, cd to the directory
within the expanded archive and type 
mod/powerpc/special mosinit.hoc -
to start the simulation.

-------

Choose the number of APs in a burst and press the run button. By
increasing the number of APs the calcium signal in the basal dendrites
will increase supralinearly.  3 or more APs in a burst will lead to
generation of a dendritic calcium spike similar to the experimental
results shown in Kampa &amp; Stuart (2006).

In addition, a 4-AP experiment, blocking IA channels, can be simulated
or a TTX experiment blocking local Na channels.

These NEURON simulator files were contributed by Arjun Masurkar.

Usage:

Autolaunch from ModelDB or download, extract, and compile the mod
files in the archive with nrnivmodl (unix), mknrndll (pc or mac) and
start with the command &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot; (unix), double click on
mosinit.hoc (windows), or drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the
nrngui icon (mac).

Once the simulation has started:

Press the button labeled &quot;Figure 7c Marsurkar, Chen 2011 (Ca2+)&quot; and
after a few seconds you should see a graph like:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=140462&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\MasurkarChen2011\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

Alternatively Press Init &amp; Run on the Run Control panel (might be
buried under other windows) to run a single pulse simulation.

   &lt;pre&gt;RMmodel.hoc
The set of .mod files and the hoc file included here implement the models
described for ventral cochlear nucleus neurons in the series of papers by
Rothman and Manis (2003a,b,c; hereafter refered to as R&amp;M;). The equations for
each channel type are implemented in separate .mod files. Please note that the
models for IA, IHT and ILT are based on actual measurements in isolate
well-voltage clamped guinea pig VCN neurons, as described in R&amp;M;, 2003b. The
models for INa and Ih are based on average kinetic measurements of those
conductances in other cell types (see R&amp;M;, 2003c), and are included as a matter
of convenience and completeness.

The files named &quot;klt_kinetics.hoc&quot;, &quot;kht_kinetics.hoc&quot;, &quot;ia_kinetics.hoc&quot;, &quot;na
kinetics.mod&quot; and &quot;ih_kinetics.hoc&quot; use only one (plus a passive conductance)
channel to show the voltage dependence of the kinetics, the effect of the
conductance on a current-clamp pulse in an otherwise passive cell, and the
voltage clamp behavior over a range of voltages. These are mainly to confirm the
behavior of the models.

The file RMmodel.hoc reproduces traces in Figures 2, 3 and 4 of Rothman and
Manis, 2003c. While the results are very close to the original models (which, in
the paper, were run in ACSL, not NEURON, although the general behavior was
verified in NEURON), in a few cases they are not identical. In particular, in
Figure 2D, the &quot;type I-II&quot; model fires 2 action potentials in response to +100
pA depolarizations, however the NEURON model only fires one action potential
followed by a subthreshold wavelet. Increasing the depolarization to +102 pA
is sufficient to reproduce the result in the paper (you can verify this by
selecting the model from the &quot;Full IV Model Selection&quot; button, entering 102 into
the &quot;IV max  (pA)&quot; box, 3 into the &quot;# IV steps&quot; box, and then hitting the &quot;Run&quot;
button) . Such differences may arise from the different integration methods
(unlikely here), or from small differences in the initial conditions for the
models in the different simulation environments.

To enable some generality to these models, an &quot;IV&quot; mode is included. To use this
, select the model, and set the IV max current and the number of steps. The
model cell will then be presented with -imax to +imax current steps. You can use
this to explore, for example, the range over which the intermediate cell classes
(type II-I and type I-II fire 1, 2, 3 or a train of action potentials, depending
on the size of the low threshold conductance.

Also included is a &quot;type II-o&quot; model, which is not in the original papers
reached from the Full IV Model Selection&quot; menu. This is modified, hybrid Type II
model, with a very large low threshold potassium conductance, coupled with the
Milgore (see NeuronDB) implementation of the Ih meausrements of Bal and Oertel,
2000 (hcno.mod). The model is designed to approximate a posterior ventral
cochlear nucleus Octopus neuron. For comparison with published studies, it will
be necessary to change the temperature in NEURON from 22 to 33 deg. C (Tools -&amp;gt;
Distributed Mechanisms -&amp;gt; Celsius).

Any questions regarding these implementations should be directed to:

  <description>
   Using kinetic data from three different K+ currents in acutely isolated neurons, a single electrical compartment model representing the soma of a ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) neuron was created. The K+ currents include a fast transient current (IA), a slow-inactivating low-threshold current (ILT), and a noninactivating high-threshold current (IHT). The model also includes a fast-inactivating Na+ current, a hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih), and 1-50 auditory nerve synapses. With this model, the role IA, ILT, and IHT play in shaping the discharge patterns of VCN cells is explored. Simulation results indicate these currents have specific roles in shaping the firing patterns of stellate and bushy CN cells.  (see readme.txt and the papers, esp 2003c, for details).

This example produces figure 3 of the paper.  The implementation is
derived from the paper and is not based on the original code. 
Discrepancies in minor quantitative details are those that depend on a
few tenths of a degC changes in celsius.  The current version of NEURON
(v5.2) does not allow use of secondorder=2 in the presence of the
extracellular mechanism.

   &lt;pre&gt;Version 2002-08-30 contains modifications for variable time step method.
Version 2011-02-02 makes all mod files threadsafe.  For cad.mod this 
required replacing euler by cnexp, which changes spike times slightly
but has no effect on qualitative results.

This readme file gives usage instructions for patdemo2.zip (essentially
patdemo.zip at http://www.cnl.salk.edu/~zach/methods.html by Z. F. Mainen
and T. J. Sejnowski)

This model contains compartmental models of four reconstructed neocortical
neurons (Layer 3 Aspiny, layer 4 Stellate, layer 3 and layer 5 Pyramidal
neurons) with active dendritic currents using NEURON. It is shown here that
an entire spectrum of firing patterns can be reproduced in this set of model
neurons which share a common distribution of ion channels and differ only in
their dendritic geometry.

on firing pattern in model neocortical neurons. Nature 382: 363-366.

This package is written in the NEURON simulation program written by Michael
Hines and available on internet at:

  HOW TO RUN (under NEURON version 4 and higher)
  =========================================

To compile the demo, NEURON and INTERVIEWS must be installed and working on
the machine you are using.

When the patdemo1.zip file is unzipped it creates a patdemo directory which
contains the hoc and mod NEURON program files.  Change directory to patdemo.

under UNIX:
===========

Just type &quot;nrnivmodl&quot; to compile the mechanisms
given in the mod files in the patdemo directory.

Execute the first figure demo program by typing:

nrngui demofig1.hoc

continue below under back to any platform:

under MS WINDOWS (PC):
======================

Press Start button (lower left corner) and then press Programs and then
NEURON and then mknrndll DOS box.  Change directory to where the zip file was
unzipped and enter the directory that came with the zip file (patdemo). Type
mknrndll and press the Enter key.

Execute the first figure demo program by typing:

nrngui

In the NEURON main menu click on file and open and then double click on
demofig1.hoc

continue below:

back to any platform:
=====================

For each of the cells, click on one of the cell buttons in the
figure 1 window - for example

a. L3 Aspiny

and then click on the Init &amp; Run button to observe the voltage trace.

to explore the figure 2 model quit (click on file and then quit in the NEURON main
menu) and start up again using the command:

nrngui demofig2.hoc

To explore parameters in these models, on the NEURON main menu click on
Tools, Distributed Mechanisms, Viewers, and Name Values

When the special window comes up double click on one of the sections in the
left hand column, e.g. soma and then finally you can observe/change the
parameters of the model.  Note for example that changing the morphology of
the model, e.g. changing L, will cause the model to change shape in the
Shape window.  If you closed the shape window press one of the cell buttons
again in the Figure 1 window.  At any time you can test how any of your modifications
change the electrical excitability by pressing Init &amp; Run.

If you wish to change the current injected into the model, on the NEURON main
menu click on Tools, Point Processes, Viewers, and IClamp.  Then on the new
IClamp window double click on &quot;soma(0.5)&quot;.  The on the &quot;IClamp[] at soma(.5)&quot;
modify the protocol by for example changing the amplitude (amp) of the current
to a value that is for example .02 nA larger.  To compare with the previous
run of the model right click on the graph of v(.5), and select the menu item
&quot;Keep Lines&quot;.  Notice that there are many ways to to zoom/scroll the graph by
right clicking on the graph and slide to the top of the pop-up menu to the
View... menu and then slide off to the right and select one of these items.

   &lt;pre&gt;This is the readme for the model code for the paper

Artificial evolution of neurons optimized for specific computations.
Klaus M. Stiefel and Terrence J. Sejnowski
Journal of Neurophysiology

This model code was contributed to ModelDB by Klaus Stiefel..

How to run the demonstration files:

1. If you have not already done so, install NEURON. 

Windows, Linux and OS10 versions of this program can be downloaded
free of charge from

http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/install/install.html

2. Run GA.hoc to start a run of the genetic algorithm. During each
generation, the morphologies of the first 16 neurons of the population
and their somatic membrane potentials are plotted. The parameters of
the genetic algorithm (population size, mutation rates &amp;hellip;) can be
modified in the first block of GA.hoc. The extent of the synapse-space
can be modified in template.hoc.

3. The simulation will save a text-file &amp;ldquo;Generation#.txt&amp;rdquo; after
completion of each generation.  To load the best performing neuron of
a generation, run LOAD_WINNER.hoc, specify the generation and press
the &amp;ldquo;Load&amp;rdquo; button.

4. The code runs the optimization for linear summation. If you would
like to change it to spike-order detection, to change GA.hoc in lines
98, 99 and lines 83, 84 so that &quot;ordertest.hoc&quot; is loaded and
executed, and

	 LOAD_WINNER.hoc in lines 31, 32 and 55, 56.

6/8/2007 version update: a short run test was added to auto-launch options

   &quot;... We used an optimization procedure to find neuronal morphological
structures for two computational tasks: First, neuronal morphologies were selected for
linearly summing excitatory synaptic potentials (EPSPs); second, structures were
selected that distinguished the temporal order of EPSPs. The solutions resembled the
morphology of real neurons. In particular the neurons optimized for linear summation
electrotonically separated their synapses, as found in avian nucleus laminaris neurons,
and neurons optimized for spike-order detection had primary dendrites of significantly
different diameter, as found in the basal and apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal
neurons. ...&quot;Reference: Stiefel KM, Sejnowski TJ (2007) Mapping Function onto Neuronal Morphology.  98:513-526

Notes:

To recreate the simulations found in Figures 7A and 7B of the paper
please load either withSKsoma.hoc or noSKsoma.hoc, depending on the
condition of interest. This will automatically load a session that
will give you a plot of voltage against time on the left and a plot of
the availabilities of the Na+ and K+ channels against voltage on the
right.  If you do this for the withSKsoma.hoc you will see a set of
graphs that should look like the following:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=122329&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\GPSingleCompartment\Grab1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Grab1.jpg&quot; /&gt;

Please note that up to the first 5 seconds of the simulation have a
subtle slow transient, which may affect your ability to recreate the
plot precisely. In our paper, we ran the simulations for 10 seconds
and discarded the first 5 seconds. Figure 7 in the paper shows the
last second of simulated activity.

I have tried to make things easy to obtain a set of graphs that is
free of transients and more closely mirrors the paper (random numbers
are involved so it will not be exact).  To do this load the file as
outlined before and close all graphs, then click &quot;init&quot; in the
RunControl, then set, in the RunControl dialog, &quot;Continue til&quot; to 8000
ms (should already be done for you) and then click that button. Once
the simulation timer &quot;t&quot; reaches 8000 you can then load
&quot;availNoTrans.ses&quot; by choosing load session from the File menu and
then click in the RunControl &quot;Continue for (ms),&quot; which should be set
to 1000. If you do this for the noSKsoma.hoc file, you should end up
with a set of graphs that looks like the following: 

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=122329&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\GPSingleCompartment\Grab2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Grab2.jpg&quot; /&gt;

   &quot; ... In numerical simulations, the availability of both Na+ and A-type K+ channels during autonomous firing were reduced when SK channels were removed, and a nearly equal reduction in Na+ and K+ subthreshold-activated ion channel availability produced a large decrease in the neuron's slope conductance near threshold. 

This change made the neuron more sensitive to intrinsically generated noise.

In vivo, this change would also enhance the sensitivity of GP (Globus Pallidus) neurons to small synaptic inputs.&quot;

This is the readme for the NEURON model from the paper:

Ferrante et al, Computational models of neuronal biophysics and the
characterization of potential neuropharmacological targets. Curr Med
Chem. 2008;15(24):2456-71.

In this paper, the model shows how different types of neuroactive
drugs and drugs interactions influence the signal generation,
integration and propagation. Specifically Fig.4E.hoc produces a plot
of the somatic voltage traces shown in Fig. 4E of the paper.

Under linux/unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui fig.4E.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
Fig.4E.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Under MAC OS X:
to compile the mod files drag and drop the extracted folder onto the
mknrndll icon. Drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui
icon.

Once NEURON started you can press the &quot;(1-4) Gray - Control&quot; button.
Then when the simulation is done click on the graphs upper left pull
down menu box and select &quot;Keep lines&quot;.  Finally, press the button
labeled &quot;(1) Black - Lamotrigine&quot;, and you should get a graph that
combines the black and gray traces of Fig. 4E and looks something
like:

Korngreen A, Kaiser KM, Zilberter Y (2005) Subthreshold inactivation
of voltage-gated K+ channels modulates action potentials in
neocortical bitufted interneurones from rats. J Physiol 562:421-37

Abstract:

Voltage-gated K+ channels perform many functions in integration of
synaptic input and action potential (AP) generation. In this study we
show that in bitufted interneurones from layer 2/3 of the
somatosensory cortex, the height and width of APs recorded at the soma
are sensitive to changes in the resting membrane potential, suggesting
subthreshold activity of voltage-gated conductances. Attributes of K+
currents examined in nucleated patches revealed a fast
subthreshold-inactivating K+ conductance (Kf) and a slow
suprathreshold-inactivating K+ conductance (Ks). Simulations of these
K+ conductances, incorporated into a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model,
suggested that during a single AP or during low frequency trains of
APs, subthreshold inactivation of Kf was the primary modulator of AP
shape, whereas during trains of APs the shape was governed to a larger
degree by Ks resulting in the generation of smaller and broader
APs. Utilizing the facilitating function of unitary
pyramidal-to-bitufted cell synaptic transmission, single
back-propagating APs were initiated in a bitufted interneurone by
repeated stimulation of a presynaptic pyramidal cell. Ca2+ imaging and
dendritic whole-cell recordings revealed that modulation of APs, which
also affect the shape of back-propagating APs, resulted in a change in
dendritic Ca2+ influx. Compartmental simulation of the
back-propagating AP suggested a mechanism for the modulation of the
back-propagating AP height and width by subthreshold activation of
Kf. We speculate that this signal may modulate retrograde GABA release
and consequently depression of synaptic efficacy of excitatory input
from neighbouring pyramidal neurones.

The mod files for Kf and Ks are supplied here by Dr Alon Korngreen.

Sonia Gasparini, Michele Migliore, and Jeffrey C. Magee
On the initiation and propagation of dendritic spikes in CA1 pyramidal neurons,
J.Neurosci. 24:11046-11056 (2004).

The paper investigates the dendritic spike probability as a function 
of the number of activated synaptic input and their spatial and temporal distribution.
The results suggest that highly synchronized and moderately clustered inputs 
have the highest probability to generate a dendritic spike.

The main effect is demonstrated here by reproducing the simulations
in Fig.5A of the paper, in which 5 synapses were activated 
in the same compartment with different time delays.
Simulations can be run for different kind of synaptic input:
- current pulses 
- AMPA 
- AMPA+NMDA

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui forfig5A.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
forfig5A.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

To understand how dendritic active properties are involved in this transmission, we have combined dual soma and dendritic patch recordings with computational modeling to analyze action-potential initiation and propagation in the primary dendrite.Reference: Chen WR, Shen GY, Shepherd GM, Hines ML, Midtgaard J (2002) Multiple Modes of Action-Potential Initiation and Propagation in Mitral Cell Primary Dendrite.  88:2755-64

   &quot; ... Here we show that the voltage fluctuations associated with
dendrosomatic synaptic activity propagate significant distances
along the axon, and that modest changes in the somatic membrane
potential of the presynaptic neuron modulate the amplitude
and duration of axonal action potentials and, through a Ca21-
dependent mechanism, the average amplitude of the postsynaptic
potential evoked by these spikes. 

These results indicate that
synaptic activity in the dendrite and soma controls not only the
pattern of action potentials generated, but also the amplitude of
the synaptic potentials that these action potentials initiate in local
cortical circuits, resulting in synaptic transmission that is a
mixture of triggered and graded (analogue) signals.&quot;References: 1.

Liu Z, Golowasch J, Marder E, Abbott LF (1998)
A model neuron with activity-dependent conductances regulated by
multiple calcium sensors. J Neurosci 18:2309-20

Abstract:

Membrane channels are subject to a wide variety of regulatory
mechanisms that can be affected by activity. We present a model of a
stomatogastric ganglion (STG) neuron in which several Ca2+-dependent
pathways are used to regulate the maximal conductances of membrane
currents in an activity-dependent manner. Unlike previous models of
this type, the regulation and modification of maximal conductances by
electrical activity is unconstrained. The model has seven
voltage-dependent membrane currents and uses three Ca2+ sensors acting
on different time scales. Starting from random initial conditions over
a given range, the model sets the maximal conductances for its active
membrane currents to values that produce a predefined target pattern
of activity approximately 90% of the time. In these models, the same
pattern of electrical activity can be produced by a range of maximal
conductances, and this range is compared with voltage-clamp data from
the lateral pyloric neuron of the STG. If the electrical activity of
the model neuron is perturbed, the maximal conductances adjust to
restore the original pattern of activity. When the perturbation is
removed, the activity pattern is again restored after a transient
adjustment period, but the conductances may not return to their
initial values. The model suggests that neurons may regulate their
conductances to maintain fixed patterns of electrical activity, rather
than fixed maximal conductances, and that the regulation process
requires feedback systems capable of reacting to changes of electrical
activity on a number of different time scales.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Model Usage:

How to run the model:

Autolaunch from ModelDB and select figures by pressing buttons or
download and expand the archive.  Then on

mswin: double click on the mosinit.hoc file after compiling the mod
       files with mknrndll

unix: type &quot;nrnivmodl&quot; and enter and then &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot; in the
      expanded archive folder.

mac: after the archive is unziped drag and drop the newly created
     folder onto the mknrndll icon. Then drag and drop the mosinit.hoc
     in the folder onto the nrngui icon.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes on the recreation and verification of the model:

I recreated figure 3 because aspects of that allow for verification of
the complete model.  In this figure there are two models named model A
and model B.  These models evolve from starting conductances whose
values are shown on the left of each graph to ending conductances
whose values are shown on the right of each graph.  For each of four
cases (start and end of model A and B) voltage trajectories are
graphed in the middle and top of figure 3.  So first I verified the
underlying STG model (without activity) by plugging these values into
the model and found that it did reproduce the trajectories. Second I
verified the activity dependence by graphing the evolution of the
model conductances:
&lt;/pre&gt;

to see that they matched the bottom figure.
of the paper:
&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=93321&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\liuEtAl1998\.\fig3bottompaper.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;paper&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

The simulation results matched the paper when run for 100 seconds
(shown above).  The paper figure caption likely has a typo (Abbott,
personal communication 2007) when it mentions these runs were 15
seconds of simulation time.

See notes.txt for how to run model to examine long-term stability of
conductances.

   &quot;We investigate the effects of the stochastic nature
of ion channels on the faithfulness, precision and reproducibility
of electrical signal transmission in weakly active,
dendritic membrane under in vitro conditions. 

...

We numerically simulate the effects of stochastic ion
channels on the forward and backward propagation of dendritic
spikes in Monte-Carlo simulations on a reconstructed
layer 5 pyramidal neuron. 

We report that in most instances
there is little variation in timing or amplitude for a single
BPAP, while variable backpropagation can occur for trains
of action potentials. 

Additionally, we find that the generation
and forward propagation of dendritic Ca2+ spikes are
susceptible to channel variability. This indicates limitations
on computations that depend on the precise timing of Ca2+
spikes.&quot;Reference: Diba K, Koch C, Segev I (2006) Spike propagation in dendrites with stochastic ion channels  20:77-84

   &quot;Windup is characterized as a frequency-dependent
increase in the number of evoked action potentials in dorsal
horn neurons in response to electrical stimulation of afferent C-fibers.
... 
The approach presented here relies on mathematical and
computational analysis to study the mechanism(s) underlying windup.

From experimentally obtained windup profiles, we extract the time
scale of the facilitation mechanisms that may support the characteristics
of windup.

Guided by these values and using simulations of a
biologically realistic compartmental model of a wide dynamic range
(WDR) neuron, we are able to assess the contribution of each
mechanism for the generation of action potentials windup.

study.  Jones SR, Pritchett DL, Stufflebeam SM, Hamalainen M, Moore
CI.  J Neurosci. 2007 Oct 3;27(40):10751-64.

Previous reports conflict as to the role of primary somatosensory
neocortex (SI) in tactile detection. We addressed this question in
normal human subjects using whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG)
recording. We found that the evoked signal (0-175 ms) showed a
prominent equivalent current dipole that localized to the anterior
bank of the postcentral gyrus, area 3b of SI. The magnitude and timing
of peaks in the SI waveform were stimulus amplitude dependent and
predicted perception beginning at approximately 70 ms after
stimulus. To make a direct and principled connection between the SI
waveform and underlying neural dynamics, we developed a biophysically
realistic computational SI model that contained excitatory and
inhibitory neurons in supragranular and infragranular layers. The SI
evoked response was successfully reproduced from the intracellular
currents in pyramidal neurons driven by a sequence of lamina-specific
excitatory input, consisting of output from the granular layer
(approximately 25 ms), exogenous input to the supragranular layers
(approximately 70 ms), and a second wave of granular output
(approximately 135 ms). The model also predicted that SI correlates of
perception reflect stronger and shorter-latency supragranular and late
granular drive during perceived trials. These findings strongly
support the view that signatures of tactile detection are present in
human SI and are mediated by local neural dynamics induced by
lamina-specific synaptic drive. Furthermore, our model provides a
biophysically realistic solution to the MEG signal and can predict the
electrophysiological correlates of human perception.


Implementor's Notes:

The implementation of the S1 soamtosemsory cortex is an ongoing
effort.  The present version has been explanded from its present one
dimensional geometry to a two dimensional cortical sheet. We
anticipate this will be posted on ModelDB once the results from it
have been published. See http://CompNeuroSci.info for updates.

Executing &quot;nrniv batch.hoc -&quot; will generate a concatenated file
representing 100 trial runs. To replicate the simulation figures in
the paper the relevant configuration file is specified (see below),
and the averaged waveforms are filtered (see paper).

The demo of the simulation illustrates a single trial run. After
compiling all mod files run 'nrngui' then load hoc file
'init-cortex.hoc'. After loading one of the three configuration files;
load demo.ses and a short time later the following figures should
appear (the example below used the wiring-config_suprathresh.hoc
configuration file). Restart with each configuration file.

These model files were supplied by Roger Traub with minor fixes
by Tom Morse and Michael Hines. 7/14/06

Note: in the file, job, the cd /home/traub/groucho will need to be
replaced with cd /home/yourdirectory/groucho which is where you issue
the qsub command.  Also you may need an extra path like:

# for LAM/Intel MPI version
export PATH=$PATH:.:/usr/local/lam/bin

supplied in your .bashrc file.  Here are some guidelines supplied
by Roger Traub on building and running the model:

1st compile all the integration subroutines, with compile_integration,
which uses ifc.

Then type &quot;make&quot;, which compiles the main program (with mpifwhatever) 
and links everything to give an executable. Then &quot;qsub job&quot;, which 
ships the lot to the master node of the Linux cluster; that in turn 
loads the stuff onto 14 cpu's.

groucho.f = main program
compile_integration = does what it says, compiles integration subroutines
makefile creates an executable for &quot;job&quot;
job = what gets submitted, with command &quot;qsub job&quot;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

   To better understand population phenomena in thalamocortical neuronal ensembles,
we have constructed a preliminary network model with 3,560 multicompartment neurons
(containing soma, branching dendrites, and a portion of axon). Types of neurons included
superficial pyramids (with regular spiking [RS] and fast rhythmic bursting [FRB] firing
behaviors); RS spiny stellates; fast spiking (FS) interneurons, with basket-type and axoaxonic
types of connectivity, and located in superficial and deep cortical layers; low threshold spiking
(LTS) interneurons, that contacted principal cell dendrites; deep pyramids, that could have RS or
intrinsic bursting (IB) firing behaviors, and endowed either with non-tufted apical dendrites or
with long tufted apical dendrites; thalamocortical relay (TCR) cells; and nucleus reticularis
(nRT) cells. To the extent possible, both electrophysiology and synaptic connectivity were
based on published data, although many arbitrary choices were necessary.References: 1.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) 27:
11453-11458, (2007).

A simple model of a soma and axon was constructed by using Neuron.

The soma had a diameter and length of 20 mm (1 compartment) and
contained a leak conductance (reversal potential -70 mV) Rm = 30,000
Ohm/cm2 with membrane capacitance Cm = 0.75 mF/cm2.

The axon had a diameter of 1 mm and a length of between 20 and 200 mm,
with the later containing 10 compartments. In the axon, the leak
conductance Rm = 125,000 Ohm/cm2, and the membrane capacitance Cm =
0.75 mF/cm2. The axonal axial resistance was 150 W-cm.

Kv1.2 current exists in axon initial segment, which play important
roles in modulating spike duration and threshold of action potentials.

Running Neuron_Dcurrent.hoc, then analyze the output data file
soma_axon_id.dat to see D current effect on action potentials

Durstewitz D, Seamans JK, Sejnowski TJ (2000) Dopamine-mediated
stabilization of delay-period activity in a network model of
prefrontal cortex. J Neurophysiol 83:1733-50

Abstract:

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critically involved in working memory,
which underlies memory-guided, goal-directed behavior. During
working-memory tasks, PFC neurons exhibit sustained elevated activity,
which may reflect the active holding of goal-related information or
the preparation of forthcoming actions. Dopamine via the D1 receptor
strongly modulates both this sustained (delay-period) activity and
behavioral performance in working-memory tasks. However, the function
of dopamine during delay-period activity and the underlying neural
mechanisms are only poorly understood. Recently we proposed that
dopamine might stabilize active neural representations in PFC circuits
during tasks involving working memory and render them robust against
interfering stimuli and noise. To further test this idea and to
examine the dopamine-modulated ionic currents that could give rise to
increased stability of neural representations, we developed a network
model of the PFC consisting of multicompartment neurons equipped with
Hodgkin-Huxley-like channel kinetics that could reproduce in vitro
whole cell and in vivo recordings from PFC neurons. Dopaminergic
effects on intrinsic ionic and synaptic conductances were implemented
in the model based on in vitro data. Simulated dopamine strongly
enhanced high, delay-type activity but not low, spontaneous activity
in the model network. Furthermore the strength of an afferent
stimulation needed to disrupt delay-type activity increased with the
magnitude of the dopamine-induced shifts in network parameters, making
the currently active representation much more stable. Stability could
be increased by dopamine-induced enhancements of the persistent Na(+)
and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) conductances. Stability also was
enhanced by a reduction in AMPA conductances. The increase in GABA(A)
conductances that occurs after stimulation of dopaminergic D1
receptors was necessary in this context to prevent uncontrolled,
spontaneous switches into high-activity states (i.e., spontaneous
activation of task-irrelevant representations). In conclusion, the
dopamine-induced changes in the biophysical properties of intrinsic
ionic and synaptic conductances conjointly acted to highly increase
stability of activated representations in PFC networks and at the same
time retain control over network behavior and thus preserve its
ability to adequately respond to task-related stimuli. Predictions of
the model can be tested in vivo by locally applying specific D1
receptor, NMDA, or GABA(A) antagonists while recording from PFC
neurons in delayed reaction-type tasks with interfering stimuli.

for Na+, K+, Ca2+ were incorporated into the soma of the model.
The equations that simulated the Na+/K+ ATPase are described in Table

Abstract

Alcohol Excites Cerebellar Golgi Cells by Inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase
Patch-clamp in cerebellar slices and computer modeling show that
ethanol excites Golgi cells by inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase. In
particular, voltage-clamp recordings of Na+/K+ ATPase currents
indicated that ethanol partially inhibits this pump and this effect
could be mimicked by low concentrations of the Na+/K+ ATPase blocker
ouabain. The partial inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase in a computer model
of the Golgi cell reproduced these experimental findings that
established a novel mechanism of action of ethanol on neural
excitability.

The partial inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase in a computer model of the Golgi cell reproduced these experimental findings that established a novel mechanism of action of ethanol on neural excitability.Reference: Botta P, de Souza FM, Sangrey T, De Schutter E, Valenzuela CF (2010) Alcohol excites cerebellar Golgi cells by inhibiting the Na(+)-K(+) ATPase.  35:1984-96

EM Izhikevich &quot;Simple Model of Spiking Neurons&quot;
IEEE Transactions On Neural Networks, Vol. 14, No. 6, November 2003 pp 1569-1572

Files:
izh.m // Matlab program to replicate firing patterns 
izh.gif // illustration of firing patterns
izh.mod // Neuron mod file to replicate firing patterns (note limitations below)
izh.hoc // Neuron hoc file

Usage :
matlab izh.m 
    OR
nrnivmodl izh
nrngui izh.hoc

solves the following equations:

 v' = e*v^2 + f*v + g - u + I;    RESET if (v&amp;gt;30) v=c
 u' = a*(b*v-u);                  RESET if (v&amp;gt;30) u=u+d
(note that vv is used in Neuron for voltage so doesn't interfere with built-in v of cell)


a,b,c,d,I are the major parameters; 
f,g are reset for 2 simulations (G-&quot;Class 1&quot; and L-&quot;integrator&quot;)
all parameters can be controlled from parameter panel

3 of the simulations shown in izh.gif are not properly replicated:
Q: depolarizing afterpotential does not repolarize properly
R: accomodation requires an alteration of the functional forms to replicate
   (alternate functional form given on line 52 of izh.mod)
T: too unstable for Neuron integrators to handle
   (changing izh.hoc line 203 to Isend1(50,75) will crash simulator)

izhstim() // sets up a single NetStim input at 1 ms into the Izhikevich cell

   A model is presented that reproduces spiking and bursting
behavior of known types of cortical neurons. The model combines the biologically
plausibility of Hodgkin&amp;ndash;Huxley-type dynamics and the computational
efficiency of integrate-and-fire neurons. Using this model, one can
simulate tens of thousands of spiking cortical neurons in real time (1 ms
resolution) using a desktop PC.Reference: Izhikevich EM (2003) Simple model of spiking neurons. IEEE Trans Neural Netw 14:1569-72

INSTALLATION

1. Install the required Python modules:
NumPy (http://numpy.scipy.org)
SciPy (http://www.scipy.org/SciPy)
Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/index.html)

Installation instructions can be found on the respective web sites.

2. NEURON and Python
Install NEURON with Python support. At the time of writing,
the binary distribution won't do and you'll have to compile
NEURON from source.

See 
http://www.davison.webfactional.com/notes/installation-neuron-python/
for instructions.

3. Optional
To solve kinetic gating schemes without NEURON, you'll need pyqmatrix:

http://code.google.com/p/pyqmatrix

USAGE

1. Compile the mechanism files in the mod directory:
$ nrnivmodl mod

2. Run the example simulations:

# Simple current-clamp simulation
$ python ap.py

# Voltage-clamp simulation comparing Q-Matrix and NEURON results:
$ python qmatrix.py

CHANGELOG

na8st-1.1 (1.1)

  * Pointing out discrepancies in \bar{g}_{Na} computations.
    Thanks to Steffen Platschek for pointing this out.

  <description>
   &quot;... To study the mechanisms underlying AP initiation in unmyelinated hippocampal mossy fibers of adult mice, we recorded sodium currents in axonal and somatic membrane patches. 

We demonstrate that sodium channel density in the proximal axon is ~5 times higher than in the soma. 

Furthermore, sodium channel activation and inactivation are ~2 times faster. 

Modeling revealed that the fast activation localized the initiation site to the proximal axon even upon strong synaptic stimulation, while fast inactivation contributed to energy-efficient membrane charging during APs. ...&quot;Reference: Schmidt-Hieber C, Bischofberger J (2010) Fast Sodium Channel Gating Supports Localized and Efficient Axonal Action Potential Initiation

   &lt;pre&gt;Model of recurrent cyclic inhibition as described on p.119 of Friesen and
Friesen (1994), which was slightly modified from Szekely's model (1965).
The conditions for oscillation are:
(1) the loop must contain an odd number of neurons,
(2) each of which can significantly inhibit its target,
and (3) the excitatory drive must be strong enough so the
   loop neurons will spike when released from inhibition
 
In the SpikePlot, the bottom three trains show the alternating activity of
the loop neurons.  The top three trains are the afferent excitatory streams.

potentials in hippocampal mossy fibers, Science 325, 1405-1408
(2009). doi: 10.1126/science.1174331


This directory contains mod and hoc files for the NEURON simulator, as
well as dat files representing the conductance waveforms which are
read in via the stepforce() function in GNa.mod, GK.mod and
GCa.mod.

To run the simulations, follow these steps:

1. compile the mod files using nrnivmodl under Mac OS X and Linux, or
mknrndll under Windows

2. run reconstitution.hoc in NEURON. This performs the simulation
shown in Fig. 2A and B of the paper and plots the results using
NEURON's graphical user interface.

3. if desired you can perform an automated fit of the measured action
potential waveform by running fit_th1.hoc. This writes results to
three files: parameters1.txt, measuredAP1.txt, and modelAP1.txt and
may take several hours.

This simple axon-soma model explained how the rapid rising phase in
somatic spike is derived from propagated axon initiated spike.

Creates a single cell containing a dendrite, soma, an axon with 60
micrometer and a axon bleb to investigate generation of spike kink at
soma. As observed in experiment, spikes are usually initiated at the
axon site 40~70 micrometer away from soma.  There is a rapid rising
phase in somatic spike, due to the initial segment traveling spike.

After running the code, there is an output data file called
'neuron_soma.dat' Use the matlab code for_plot_spike.m to plot the
somatic spike and axon spike.

This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:

G. G. Somjen, H. Kager, W. J. Wadman.  (2008) Computer simulations of
neuron-glia interactions mediated by ion flux. J Comput Neurosci
DOI 10.1007/s10827-008-0083-9

Abstract:
Extracellular potassium concentration, [K+]o, and intracellular
calcium, [Ca2+]i, rise during neuron excitation, seizures and
spreading depression.  Astrocytes probably restrain the rise of K+ in
a way that is only partly understood.  To examine the effect of glial
K+ uptake, we used a model neuron equipped with Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Clâ&amp;circ;&amp;rsquo;
conductances, ion pumps and ion exchangers, surrounded by interstitial
space and glia.  The glial membrane was either &quot;passive&quot;,
incorporating only leak channels and an ion exchange pump, or it had
rectifying K+ channels. We computed ion fluxes, concentration changes
and osmotic volume changes.  Increase of [K+]o stimulated the glial
uptake by the glial 3Na/2K ion pump. The [K+]o flux through glial leak
and rectifier channels was outward as long as the driving potential
was outwardly directed, but it turned inward when rising [K+]o/[K+]i
ratio reversed the driving potential.  Adjustments of glial membrane
parameters influenced the neuronal firing patterns, the length of
paroxysmal afterdischarge and the ignition point of spreading
depression.  We conclude that voltage gated K+ currents can boost the
effectiveness of the glial &quot;potassium buffer&quot; and that this buffer
function is important even at moderate or low levels of excitation,
but especially so in pathological states.

-----------------------
The model files were supplied by the authors.

Usage:

Autolaunch from ModelDB or download the and expand the zip zip
file. Then under Windows, run mknrndll and cd to the new folder and
make the nrnmech.dll under MAC OS X, drag and drop the new folder onto
the mknrndll icon, then drag the mosinit.hoc file onto nrngui, under
linux, run &quot;nrnivmodl&quot; after cd'ing to the new folder, then type
&quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot;.

Once the simulation in the PointProcessManager window select
Show -&gt; Parameters
and change the amp (nA) to 0.1675

In the RunControl window select &quot;Init &amp; Run&quot;.  If you would like the
simulation to finish faster click on Hide on the 6 Graph windows and
then unhide them when the simulation time reaches 6000 (and stops).
You can unhide them by selecting

Window -&gt; Graph[X]

where X =0 to 5 in the NEURON Main Menu window.

This will produce graphs similar to fig 3 in the paper, for example:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=113446&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\NEURON-2008b\.\screenshot1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;graph similar to Fig 3a&quot; /&gt;

J Comput Neurosci (accepted).

The pardentategyrus and nrntraub folders contain splitcell
parallelized versions of the ModelDB models used in fig 3 of the above
paper.

Original serial versions of the models are at
http://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=51781
http://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=45539
Splitcell modifications to the Santhakumar model began with the
pardentategyrus code at
http://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=64229

Note: for autolaunch from ModelDB, after the choice of which of the two
figure 3 models to run, an attempt is made to do the appropriate
nrnivmodl or mknrndll and dynamically load the shared library or dll.
The simulation will stop after setup when launched using the mosinit.hoc
file.

In the pardentgyrus directory, see bg.sh for an example of how
these simulations were run in parallel on the BlueGene.

   Neuron tree topology equations can be split into two subtrees and solved
on different processors with no change in accuracy, stability, or
computational effort; communication costs involve only sending and
receiving two double precision values by each subtree at each time step.
Application of the cell splitting method to two published
network models exhibits good runtime scaling on twice as many
processors as could be effectively used with whole-cell balancing.

R. Bal and D. Oertel
Hyperpolarization-activated, mixed-cation current (Ih)
in octopus cells of the mammalian Cochlear Nucleus,
J. Neurophysiol. 84, 806-817 (2000)

The current has been modeled as two independent HH-like gates 
with the same activation curve but different time constants (fast and slow).
The two gates are added to give the current as :
 
i_hcno = gbar_hcno*(v-eh)*(h1*frac+h2*(1-frac))
 
Running the kinetics.hoc simulation file will show 
the activation steady-state, the time constants, a simple simulation
using a somatic current injection of -1.3nA, and a family of curves
generated modeling the same protocol used in the experiments 
for Fig.6A of the paper. For Fig.6A the peak conductance has been adjusted
to give approximately the same currents shown in the paper.

The time constants reported in the paper are shown
as markers of different colors. 
Time constants in the range not covered by the paper are an arbitrary
extension.
 
By changing the frac and color parameters 
one can model the relative percentage of fast and slow gates.
 
Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui kinetics.hoc

Under Windows using NEURON 5.1:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
kinetics.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

This is the readme for the model code for the paper:

Carvalho TP, Buonomano DV (2009) Differential effects of excitatory
and inhibitory plasticity on synaptically driven neuronal input-output
functions. Neuron 61:774-85

These files were contributed by Dean Buonomano.

Usage:

- Extract the archive.  These programs were originally in
  C:\CarvalhoBuonomano\Neuron\
- Use Neuron 6.1
- You may need to recompile the mod files by running mknrndll.
- Double click X_SynSpace
- Press Multi() on the panel on the right. The simulation starts. You
  may want to disable the graphics in synspace.oc and restart, it may
  take up to 10-18 hours.
- Copy the generated &quot;SynSpace_Out.dat&quot; and &quot;SynSpace_Param.dat&quot; to
  the Matlab directory.


GENERATE THE PARAMETER SCAN OF FIG. 1D

- Open Matlab R2007a and run &quot;analize_synaptic_space&quot;.
- Leave the previously generated variables in the Matlab workspace and
  run &quot;PLOT_synaptic_space&quot;.  You should get a plot containing some of
  Figure 1 D, E:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=125689&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\CarvalhoBuonomano\.\F1_ParamScan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

Caveat: Old fashion pointers instead of netcon are used.  It is
recomended to instead use netcon for future work.

Note: ModelDB auto-launch starts a graphical interface to parameter
exploration code so that a modeler can expore the simulation with
modelview for example.

20111101 The Neuron2009/EPlasSom.mod file was updated to use the cnexp
method: see http://www.neuron.yale.edu/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t;=592

Here, theoretical analyses reveal that excitatory synaptic
strength controls the threshold of the neuronal
input-output function, while inhibitory plasticity
alters the threshold and gain.

Experimentally, changes in the balance of excitation and inhibition
in CA1 pyramidal neurons also altered their input-output
function as predicted by the model.

These results support the existence of two functional
modes of plasticity that can be used to optimize
information processing: threshold and gain plasticity.&quot;Reference: Carvalho TP, Buonomano DV (2009) Differential effects of excitatory and inhibitory plasticity on synaptically driven neuronal input-output functions.  61:774-85

Running the kinetics.hoc simulation file will show 
the activation and inactivation steady-states, the time constants, 
and a family of curves generated modeling the same protocols 
used for Figs.6B-C of the paper.

Markers show the experimental values reported in the paper (Table.1).
For the I-A current, two parameters (shi_kamt and sha_kamt) 
have been introduced to take into account the shift in the kinetics (Fig.4B) 
observed using different bathing solutions 
(with or without Ca++, see legend of Fig.4). 
Default values for shi_kamt (inactivation) and sha_kamt (activation)
are 5.7 and 9.9mV, respectively. 
shi_kamt = sha_kamt = 0 was used here (solid lines in Fig.4B).
 
Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command

   A computational model of the rat subthalamic nucleus projection neuron is constructed using electrophysiological and morphological data and a restricted set of channel specifications. The model cell exhibits a wide range of electrophysiological behaviors characteristic of rat subthalamic neurons. It reveals that a key set of three channels play a primary role in distinguishing behaviors: a high-voltage-activated calcium channel (Cav 1.2.-1.3), a low-voltage-activated calcium channel (Cav 3.-), and a small current calcium-activated potassium channel (KCa 2.1-2.3). See paper for more and details.Reference: Gillies A, Willshaw D (2006) Membrane channel interactions underlying rat subthalamic projection neuron rhythmic and bursting activity.  95:2352-65

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Instructions about the LongDendrite and ShortDendrite Programs %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

LongDendrite is the directory including the programs to study the
influence of the synaptic input location in a lateral dendrite with
100 compartments.  ShortDendrite is the directory to study, first the
influence of varying the intermediate resistance between the lateral
dendrite and the soma of the Davison Cell (taken from Davison et al
2003) and second the influence of noise on ISI distribution.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Under Linux:%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%---------------------------------------------------------------
% 1 % -Access to the programm interface
%%%%%---------------------------------------------------------------

Open a terminal.

Go to the directory LongDendrite or ShortDendrite
Compile the mod files at least the first time you use the programs in
typing &quot; nrnivmodl &quot;
Start Neuron and the programs, in typing &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc &quot;

%%%%%---------------------------------------------------------------
% 2 -Run the experiments
%%%%%---------------------------------------------------------------

2-1 The Long Dendrite experiments
-----------------------------------

If you are in the directory LongDendrite, then you have the choice to
run the experiments related to either the Figure1 or the Figure2.
If you click on the Figure1 then you have the choice between the
fig1bde and the fig1fg. You just have to click on the button to run
it.

For example clicking on Figure 1 and then fig 1_bde will display after
some minutes

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=116094&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\DendroDendriticInhibition\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

Before running it, you may want to change some parameters. Some are
specific for the fig2bde, these will not change anything to the fig1fg.

If you click on Figure2, then you have only one choice of experiment
and you can choose the parameters you want.

In any case to choose the parameters, you can either roll the rolling
button or type directly the value in the case.

2-2 The Short Dendrite experiments.
------------------------------------

If you are in the ShortDendrite directory, after compiling the mod
files and starting NEURON, you can choose to realize the six figures
and then you click the associated subfigure buttons names.

Be careful, a new run of one experiments run over precedent data file,
if you want to save the previous data files, remove them from the
directory.

Finally, experiments 4 and 6 might take at least one day or even more,
depending on the number of trials and the machine you run the
experiments. Closing the figure, help going slighltly faster.


%%%%%---------------------------------------------------------------
% 3  -Plot the figures
%%%%%---------------------------------------------------------------

To represent the figures, then open matlab, &quot;matlab&quot; command.  Go to
the directory ShortDendrite or LongDendrite

In the LongDendrite directory, you can type the name of the programs:

fig1bde         note: you need to superpose figure1cde to it for the
                complete figure. To do this, go to the ShortDednrite
                directory and type the command figure1cde

fig1fg		note: you need to superpose figure1fg to it. To do 
                this, go to the ShortDednrite directory and type the
                command figure1fg
fig2ace

All the parameters and data file names are already set.

In the Shortdendrite directory, you can type the name of the programs:
figure1cde
figure1fg
figure2bdf
figure3
figure4abcd(n_trial,gI)
figure4ef(n_trial)
figure5(n_trial)
figure6(n_trial)

For fig 1d and 1e, to represent the result of the long dendrite and
the short dendrite on the same graph, it is necessary to play with the
index of fig and hold on the figures, in the matlab programs.

n_trial is the number of noise realization that has been set in the
parameter box in the GUI interface of Neuron.  gI is the conductance
of the inhibitory event.

For the fig4 and 6 at least 200 hundred trials are necessary to have
an idea of the result, and 5000 are necessary to have a good-looking
graph shape and a good significativity.


For fig5 at least 20 trials are necessary for a result and 50 for the
graph of the article.


Lastly, if you change some parameters which are included in the names
of the data files, then you need to change these names in the matlab
files.

PS: It is also intended that the properties of the simulation can be
explored by changing the files parameters_&lt;xxx&gt;.hoc and
experiment_&lt;/xxx&gt;&lt;xxx&gt;.hoc. It should not be necessary to change the other
files. Exceptionally you can change the bulb.hoc, and mod files (for
which you need to recompile each time you change something by the
command : nrnivmodl).

PPS: Some graphs should require some slight modifications of the
matlab programs.

NB: Sometimes, especially for the simulation with the noise, the
graphes could look like strange or different from the article. Then it
is recommended, to set the limits of ISI by hand of the histogramms
distribution instead of the automatic limit sets.

  <description>
   Mitral cells, the principal output neurons of the olfactory bulb, receive direct synaptic activation from primary sensory neurons. Shunting inhibitory inputs delivered by granule cell interneurons onto mitral cell lateral dendrites are believed to influence spike timing and underlie coordinated field potential oscillations. Lateral dendritic shunt conductances delayed spiking to a degree dependent on both their electrotonic distance and phase of onset. Recurrent inhibition significantly narrowed the distribution of mitral cell spike times, illustrating a tendency towards coordinated synchronous activity. This result suggests an essential role for early mechanisms of temporal coordination in olfaction. The model was adapted from Davison et al, 2003, but include additional noise mechanisms, long lateral dendrite, and specific synaptic point processes.Reference: David F, Linster C, Cleland TA (2008) Lateral dendritic shunt inhibition can regularize mitral cell spike patterning.  25:25-38

The set of .mod files and the hoc file included here implement the models
described for dorsal cochlear nucleus neurons (pyramidal cells) in the series of
papers by Kanold and Manis (hereafter referred to as K&amp;M; - 1999 and 2001).
The equations for each channel type are implemented in the pyr.mod file. The
Ikif and Ikis channel type models are based on experimentally determined
parameters (K&amp;M; 1999b). The models for Ina and Ih are based on model
previously described in the literature.

The file pyr.hoc reproduces traces in Figures 2, 3, 4 and 10 of K&amp;M;, 2001. The
original figures were run by programs implemented in C++, and exectued as a MEX
file under MATLAB, and these figures are confirmed in NEURON. The small
differences in the figures may arise from the different integration methods, or
from small differences in the initial conditions for the models in the different
simulation environments. For instance, the whole cell input resistance at rest
is 284 Mohms in the MATLAB model, and 300 Mohms in the NEURON model, though it
has been rescaled in this implementation.

  <description>
   Pyramidal cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) show three characteristic discharge patterns in response tones: pauser, buildup, and regular firing. Experimental evidence suggests that a rapidly inactivating K+ current (I(KIF)) plays a critical role in generating these discharge patterns. To explore the role of I(KIF), we used a computational model based on the biophysical data. The model replicated the dependence of the discharge pattern on the magnitude and duration of hyperpolarizing prepulses, and I(KIF) was necessary to convey this dependence. Experimentally, half-inactivation voltage and kinetics of I(KIF) show wide variability. Varying these parameters in the model ... suggests that pyramidal cells can adjust their sensitivity to different temporal patterns of inhibition and excitation by modulating the kinetics of I(KIF). Overall, I(KIF) is a critical conductance controlling the excitability of DCN pyramidal cells.  (See readme.txt and paper for details).

   &quot;Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is a form of associative synaptic modification which depends
on the respective timing of pre- and post-synaptic spikes. 

The biophysical mechanisms underlying this
form of plasticity are currently not known. 

We present here a biophysical model which captures the
characteristics of STDP, such as its frequency dependency, and the effects of spike pair or spike triplet
interactions.

A simplified phenomenological
model is also derived...&quot;Reference: Badoual M, Zou Q, Davison AP, Rudolph M, Bal T, Fregnac Y, Destexhe A (2006) Biophysical and phenomenological models of multiple spike interactions in spike-timing dependent plasticity.  16:79-97

This package is running with the NEURON simulation program written by
  Michael Hines and available on internet at:
  http://www.neuro.duke.edu/neuron/home.html


It contains mechanisms (.mod files) and programs (.hoc files) needed
to simulate the biophysical model, modified from the standard
Hodgkin-Huxley model, as described in a contribution in press on the
Journal of Computational Neuroscience.


Electrical synapses are common in many brain structures such as the
inferior olive, the subcoeruleus nucleus and the neocortex, between
neurons and between glial cells. In the cortex, interneurons have been
shown to be electrically coupled and proposed to participate in large,
continuous cortical syncytia, as opposed to smaller spatial domains of
electrically coupled cells. However, to explore the significance of
these findings it is imperative to map the electrical synaptic
microcircuits, in analogy with in vitro studies on monosynaptic and
disynaptic chemical coupling. Since Â&amp;ldquo;walkingÂ&amp;rdquo; from cell to cell
over large distances with a glass pipette is challenging,
microinjection of (fluorescent) dyes diffusing through gap-junctions
remains so far the only method available to decipher such
microcircuits even though technical limitations exist.

Based on circuit theory, we have derived analytical descriptions of
the AC electrical coupling in networks of isopotential cells. We have
then proposed an operative electrophysiological protocol to
distinguish between direct electrical connections and connections
involving one or more intermediate cells. This method allows inferring
the number of intermediate cells, generalizing the conventional
coupling coefficient, which provides limited information.

We provide here some analysis and simulation scripts that used to test
our method through computer simulations, in vitro recordings,
theoretical and numerical methods.

Key words: Gap-Junctions; Electrical Coupling; Networks; ZAP current;
Impedance.

List of files and directories and short description:

runme.hoc [FILE] : the main control, definition, start-stop routine to
launch the simulation!

mechanisms [DIR]

This directory contains hh2.mod (by A. Destexhe), Isin.mod and
Izap.mod (both by M. Giugliano &amp; C. Cali').

These are the mechanisms the user needs to compile (by mknrndll.exe,
under Windows), to extend the repertoire of point-process available in
NEURON, to perform ZAP-current and sinusoidal current
stimulations. Refer to manuscript as well as to the header/comments of
the *.mod files for further implementation details.

mylibs     [DIR]

This directory contains several *.hoc file, to make the definition,
run and output control of the simulation more user friendly (i.e. here
&quot;user-friendly&quot; means easy for us, and hopefully for other beginners
of NEURON like us).

gap.hoc : template for a non-rectifying resistive gap junction (by
M. Migliore)

graphs.hoc : support functions for graphical display (by A. Destexhe
and/or Z. Mainen ?)

Izap_proc.hoc : Zap current injection (user-function) procedure [it
refers, instantiate and use Izap.mod]

filemanagement.hoc : convenient (for us) encapsulation of all the
commands to prepare for data on output file..  write_on_disk.hoc :
convenient (for us) encapsulation of all the commands to prepare for
data on output file..

nsinglecompneuron.hoc : definition of the neuronal morphology,
geometry and biophysics, to be later simulated..

ncellsgj.hoc : linking by electrical coupling (i.e. gap junctions)
each cell defined by the above procedure..

output     [DIR]

This directory contains the raw (binary) data from each simulation run
(i.e. the files chirp_0v_gj.x, chirp_1v_gj.x, chirp_2v_gj.x...), but
also the MATLAB scripts (matlab/) needed to perform Fourier analysis,
to estimate the transfer functions, and to fit a canonical of rational
complex function with zeros and poles.

This directory contains &quot;plotme.m&quot; a very simple script in MATLAB to
quickly display the raw data produced by the simulation and look at
the traces..


---------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

MATLAB: performing Fourier analysis and identifying a canonical model

---------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectory &quot;output/matlab&quot; contains all the necessary code to
perform a two-steps analysis of the data produced by the simulations..

First one has to preprocess the data by calling the procedure
'preproc.m' and then invoke 'go_and_fit.m' to launch the optimzation.


Description of the scripts and functions available:

anneal.m --&amp;gt; Multidimensional constrained nonlinear minimization,
		      based on the Metropolis algorithm, known as the
		      Simulated Annealing Optimization.  This function
		      assumes the user created a matlab procedure to
		      evaluate the &quot;cost function&quot; and it needs to
		      have access to such a procedure to call it at
		      each descent/random step.


mycost.m : Cost function (see above).

tfpreprocessing.m --&amp;gt; preprocessing core function , based on standard
		      Fourier analysis techniques. It accepts from the
		      user some parameters to specify which input and
		      output waveforms need to be examined, the time
		      axis as well as how many samples at the
		      beginning and at the end of those waveforms
		      should be discarded from the analysis. The
		      function returns magnitude and phase of the
		      transfer function, in the frequency domain
		      computed by means of FFT algorithms.

These model files were created by Robert Calin-Jageman in the NEURON
simulator.

To run the model simple auto-launch from ModelDB and press &quot;Init &amp;
Run&quot; or

under linux/unix:
-----------------

nrnivmodl

then type

nrngui mosinit.hoc

in the expanded archive directory.

under mswin:
------------

compile the mod files with mknrndll, then double click on the
mosinit.hoc file

under MAC OS X:
---------------

drag and drop the ngetting folder onto the mknrndll icon, then drag
and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

(all platforms: once the simulation is loaded, then press 
&quot;Init &amp; Run&quot;)

When the model is run it should generate figures like these:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=93326&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\ngetting\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

   Classic model developed by Petter Getting of the 3-cell core CPG (DSI, C2, and VSI-B) mediating escape swimming in Tritonia diomedea. Cells use a hybrid integrate-and-fire scheme pioneered by Peter Getting. Each model cell is reconstructed from extensive physiological measurements to precisely mimic I-F curves, synaptic waveforms, and functional connectivity.  **However, continued physiological measurements show that Getting may have inadvertently incorporated modulatory and or polysynaptic effects -- the properties of this model do *not* match physiological measurements in rested preparations.**  This simulation reconstructs the Getting model as reported in: Getting (1989) 'Reconstruction of small neural networks' In Methods in Neural Modeling, 1st ed, p. 171-196.  See also, an earlier version of this model reported in Getting (1983).  Every attempt has been made to replicate the 1989 model as precisely as possible.References: 1.

Abstract:
Neurons process information in a highly nonlinear manner,
generating oscillations, bursting, and resonance, enhancing
responsiveness at preferential frequencies. It has been proposed
that slow repolarizing currents could be responsible for
both oscillation/burst termination and for high-pass filtering
that causes resonance (Hutcheon and Yarom, 2000). However,
different mechanisms, including electrotonic effects (Mainen
and Sejinowski, 1996), the expression of resurgent currents
(Raman and Bean, 1997), and network feedback, may also be
important. In this study we report theta-frequency (3-12 Hz)
bursting and resonance in rat cerebellar granule cells and show
that these neurons express a previously unidentified slow repolarizing
K1 current (IK-slow ). Our experimental and modeling
results indicate that IK-slow was necessary for both bursting and
resonance. A persistent (and potentially a resurgent) Na current
exerted complex amplifying actions on bursting and resonance,
whereas electrotonic effects were excluded by the compact
structure of the granule cell. Theta-frequency bursting and
resonance in granule cells may play an important role in determining
synchronization, rhythmicity, and learning in the
cerebellum.

Key words: bursting; resonance; M-current; cerebellum;
granule cell; modeling

Basic Model Use:
Expand archive file.  Use mknrndll (windows, mac) or nrnivmodl (unix)
to compile the mod files.  Start nrngui and load the mosinit.hoc
file to see a couple of traces from figure 6A in the paper.

Clicking on the Kinetics, Cell, or Electrodes buttons allow the
changing of these simulation parameters.

   Coupled nonlinear differential equations are derived for the dynamics
of spatially localized populations containing both excitatory and inhibitory model
neurons. Phase plane methods and numerical solutions are then used to investigate
population responses to various types of stimuli. The results obtained show simple
and multiple hysteresis phenomena and limit cycle activity. The latter is particularly
interesting since the frequency of the limit cycle oscillation is found to be a monotonic
function of stimulus intensity. Finally, it is proved that the existence of limit cycle
dynamics in response to one class of stimuli implies the existence of multiple stable
states and hysteresis in response to a different class of stimuli. The relation between
these findings and a number of experiments is discussed.Reference: Wilson HR, Cowan JD (1972) Excitatory and inhibitory interactions in localized populations of model neurons.  12:1-24

   &lt;pre&gt;NEURON mod files from the paper:
M. Migliore, On the integration of subthreshold inputs 
from Perforant Path and Schaffer collaterals in hippocampal 
CA1 pyramidal neurons, J.Comput. Neurosci., in press (2002).

The model shows how the experimentally observed increase in the
dendritic density of Ih and IA could have a major role in 
constraining the temporal integration window for the main CA1 
synaptic inputs. The main effect is demonstrated here for a 
subset of conditions from fig.4 of the paper,
which is the result of long simulations.
With the fig4.hoc file three series of simulations will run.
In all cases, two synapses in a proximal and distal compartment
will be activated at latencies between -30 and 18ms.
The three cases differ for the dendritic distribution of gKA and Ih.  
- full model, with gKA and Ih increasing with distance from soma
- uniform KA, with constant gKA and increasing Ih.
- uniform KA and Ih, with constant gKA and constant Ih.
The top simulation panel shows the membrane potential at the soma
during each simulation.
In the bottom panel a circle will be shown at the end
of each simulation. The circle will be filled if an Action Potential
was generated by the simulation.
The simulations are intended to demonstrate how
the temporal window for summation of the two inputs to elicit an AP
is affected by the experimentally observed dendritic gKA and Ih distribution.

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui fig4.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
fig4.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Questions on how to use this model
should be directed to michele.migliore@pa.ibf.cnr.it

Bugs and fixes:
04 July 2003  -  M. Migliore
A bug in the vhalfl variable declaration in h.mod
required a change of ghd in fig4.hoc (from 0.0002 to 0.0005) 
to obtain the same results.

   &quot;Dendritic electrical coupling increases the number of effective synaptic inputs
onto neurons by allowing the direct spread of synaptic potentials from one
neuron to another. 

Here we studied the summation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) produced 
locally and arriving from the coupled neuron (transjunctional) in pairs of 
electrically-coupled Retzius neurons of the leech.

We combined paired recordings of EPSPs, the production of artificial EPSPs
(APSPs) in neuron pairs with different coupling coefficients and simulations of
EPSPs produced in the coupled dendrites.

Wang XJ, Rinzel J, Rogawski MA (1991) A model of the T-type calcium
current and the low-threshold spike in thalamic neurons. 
J Neurophysiol 66:839-850

The model code was implemented in NEURON by Tom Morse.

First 400 words of the abstract from the paper:

1. A model of the transient, low-threshold voltage-dependent (T-type)
Ca2+ current is constructed using recent whole-cell voltage-clamp 
data from enzymatically isolated rat thalamocortical relay neurons. 
The T-type Ca2+ current is described according to the Hodgkin-Huxley 
scheme, using the m3h format, with rate constants determined from the
experimental data (22-24 degrees C; extracellular Ca2+ concentration
[Ca2+]o = 3 mM). 
2. The T-type Ca2+ current inactivates rapidly during maintained 
depolarization (time constant, Tau h approximately 20 ms at -20 mV), 
yet recovery from inactivation is slow (time constant, Tau_r 
approximately 270 ms at -80 mV). To reconcile these observations, a 
two-step kinetic scheme is proposed for the inactivation gate. Each of 
the time constants in this scheme is voltage dependent, with a maximum
at about -85 mV (45 ms for one and 275 ms for the other).
3. Numerical simulations of recovery in a two-pulse, voltage-clamp
protocol compare favorably with experimental results obtained by
Coulter et al. as well as those obtained in an independent series of 
experiments with guinea pig thalamic neurons ([Ca2+]o = 10 mM). 
4. For current-clamp simulations, a leakage current gL (V-VL) is 
included; with VL = -65 mV, the calculated resting membrane potential 
is -63 mV. 
5. It is shown that the T-type Ca2+ current together with the leakage 
current suffices to describe the low-threshold spike (LTS), a slow, 
triangular-shaped depolarizing event that can be evoked only from 
relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials and that underlies the 
burst firing of Na(+)-dependent action potentials in thalamic 
neurons. Outward currents are not required to reproduce the basic 
shape of the LTS. 
6. The LTS can be activated with either a depolarizing current step 
from a sufficiently hyperpolarized level or on termination of a 
hyperpolarizing current step. In either case, the amplitude of the LTS
is a monotonically increasing, sigmoid-shape function of the 
hyperpolarizing current step intensity. 
7. Because of the slower kinetic step of the channel's inactivation
gate, our model predicts that recovery of the LTS to greater than 
one-half amplitude would require a prolonged hyperpolarization of 
greater than 100 ms (at body temperature). This imposes an upper limit
(approximately 10 Hz) on the frequency of repetitive hyperpolarization
that can elicit a train of LTSs and hence on the frequency of any
rhythm that requires LTS-mediated bursting of thalamic neurons.

  <description>
   The NEURON simulation program now allows Python to be used alone or in
combination with NEURON's traditional Hoc interpreter.  Adding Python to
NEURON has the immediate benefit of making available a very extensive
suite of analysis tools written for engineering and science.  It also
catalyzes NEURON software development by offering users a modern programming
tool that is recognized for its flexibility and power to create and  
maintain complex programs.  At the same time, nothing is lost because
all existing models written in Hoc, including GUI tools, continue to
work without change and are also available within the Python context.
An example of the benefits of Python availability is the use of the xml
module in implementing NEURON's Import3D and CellBuild tools to read MorphML and
NeuroML model specifications.Reference: Hines ML, Davison AP, Muller E (2009) NEURON and Python  3:1-

   &quot;... we measured T-type current of isolated
goldfish retinal ganglion cells with perforated-patch voltageclamp
methods in solutions containing a normal extracellular Ca2+
concentration.

The voltage sensitivities and rates of current activation,
inactivation, deactivation, and recovery from inactivation were similar
to those of expressed +1G (CaV3.1) Ca2+ channel clones, except that
the rate of deactivation was significantly faster.

We reproduced the
amplitude and kinetics of measured T currents with a numerical
simulation based on a kinetic model developed for an +1G Ca2+
channel.

Finally, we show that this model predicts the increase of
T-type current made available between resting potential and spike
threshold by repetitive hyperpolarizations presented at rates that are
within the bandwidth of signals processed in situ by these neurons.&quot;Reference: Lee SC, Hayashida Y, Ishida AT (2003) Availability of Low-Threshold Ca2+ Current in Retinal Ganglion Cells  90:3888-3901

This is the readme for code in support of the paper:

Front Hum Neurosci. 2010 Nov 22;4:198. Computational modeling of
distinct neocortical oscillations driven by cell-type selective
optogenetic drive: separable resonant circuits controlled by
low-threshold spiking and fast-spiking interneurons. Vierling-Claassen
D, Cardin JA, Moore CI, Jones SR.

Code was generated using NEURON Version 6.1

Primary author of code was Dorea Vierling-Claassen (contact at
dorea@brown.edu), in consultation with Mike Sikora, based on previous
models by Stephanie R. Jones (2007 and 2009, also available on Model
DB)

TO RUN:

Compile folder using mknrndll, then run the file light_batch_FSdrive,
which generates 11 separate files, each containing 600 ms simulation,
for baseline and 10 drive frequencies in the modeled case of light
drive to fast-spiking (FS) cells case (files are saved in folder
titled &quot;batchsims&quot;)

FILE INFORMATION:

lightgamma_init_DB.hoc is called by light_batch_FSdrive and loads all
relevant processes from the following files:

1) lightgamma_network_DB.hoc defines cell morphology, intrinsic
currents and synaptic dynamics for each cell type

2) lightgamma_wiring_DB.hoc contains processes for wiring between
populations and depends on files controlling random connectivity in
confiles folder, connectivity is fixed for all runs. Connectivity
files were generated in matlab using light_genconn_DB.m, also
included. Connectivity files included here are exactly as in the
published work.

3) lightgamma_wiring_proc_DB.hoc includes processes for light drive

4) lightgamma_localconn_DB.hoc sets network connectivity

5) lightgamma_drive_DB.hoc sets light drive to either FS or RS cells,
to run the RS case, will need to comment out FS drive and comment in
RS drive in this file

6) lightgamma_noise_DB.hoc adds background noise, based on a
modification of noise from Destexhe et al 2001, also available on
model DB

7) lightgamma_LFP_DB.hoc contains process to generate average voltage
over all pyramidal cells, which was the bases for subsequent signal
processing

** This code runs the FS case, to run the case of RS drive, define new
filenames in light_batch_FS, comment out the FS drive and comment in
the RS drive in lightgamma_drive_DB**

Many thanks to other contributers to model DB's whose .mod files are
included here. Credits are in individual files and additional
citations are in the published work.

  <description>
   &quot;Selective optogenetic drive of fast-spiking (FS) interneurons (INs) leads to enhanced local field potential (LFP) power across the traditional &amp;ldquo;gamma&amp;rdquo; frequency band (20&amp;ndash;80 Hz; Cardin et al., 2009).

In contrast, drive to regular-spiking (RS) pyramidal cells enhances power at lower frequencies, with a peak at 8 Hz.

The first result is consistent with previous computational studies emphasizing the role of FS and the time constant of GABAA synaptic inhibition in gamma rhythmicity.

However, the same theoretical models do not typically predict low-frequency LFP enhancement with RS drive.

To develop hypotheses as to how the same network can support these contrasting behaviors, we constructed a biophysically principled network model of primary somatosensory neocortex containing FS, RS, and low-threshold spiking (LTS) INs. ...&quot;Reference: Vierling-Claassen D, Cardin JA, Moore CI, Jones SR (2010) Computational modeling of distinct neocortical oscillations driven by cell-type selective optogenetic drive: separable resonant circuits controlled by low-threshold spiking and fast-spiking interneurons.  4:198-

&lt;b&gt;Model description:&lt;/b&gt;

In this work, we compare the dynamics of different buffering models
during generation of a dendritic Ca2+ spike in a single compartment
model of a Purkinje cell dendrite.  The Ca2+ buffering models used are
1) a single Ca2+ pool, 2) two Ca2+ pools respectively for the fast and
slow transients, 3) a detailed calcium model with buffers, pump
(Schmidt et al., 2003), and diffusion and 4) a calcium model with
buffers, pump and diffusion compensation. The parameters of single
pool and double pool are tuned, using Neurofitter (Van Geit et al.,
2007), to approximate the behavior of detailed calcium dynamics over
range of 0.5 ÂµM to 8 ÂµM of intracellular calcium. The diffusion
compensation is modeled using a buffer-like mechanism called DCM. To
use DCM robustly for different diameter compartments, its parameters
are estimated, using Neurofitter (Van Geit et al., 2007), as a
function of compartment diameter (0.8 Âµm-20 Âµm).

&lt;b&gt;Scripts Explanation:&lt;/b&gt;

Go to the folder containing the model scripts. Run nrnivmodl. Then
type nrngui CaBufferingModels.hoc

A panel with six buttons will appear on the screen.

1.  &lt;i&gt;Detailed Calcium dynamics model:&lt;/i&gt; Click on this button to see the
behavior of detailed calcium dynamics model. It will display nine
plots arranged in three rows and three columns. The plot on the top
left corner shows calcium transients with peak amplitude of 0.5 ÂµM, 1
ÂµM and 2 ÂµM. These transients were generated using a voltage step
command (as shown in Figure 1a in Anwar et al., 2010) with different
maximal conductance values of P-type Ca2+ channel. All the other plots
show corresponding behavior of buffers and pump current. These plots
are same as Figure 2 in Anwar et al., 2010.

2.  &lt;i&gt;Calcium transients using different buffering models:&lt;/i&gt; Click on this
button to see the calcium transients with peak amplitude of 2 ÂµM,
generated using single pool, double pool, detailed calcium dynamics
model and DCM. The parameters of single pool, double pool and DCM were
fitted using Neurofitter (Van Geit et al., 2007) as described in Anwar
et al., 2010. This plot is similar to Figure 3c and Figure 6 in Anwar
et al., 2010 except that the Ca2+ transient in these scripts are shown
for diameter 4 Âµm.

3.  &lt;i&gt;Calcium spikes using single pool model:&lt;/i&gt; Click on this button to
see the calcium spikes generated using single pool model. The maximal
conductance values for P-type and T-type Ca2+ channels and BK-type and
SK-type Ca2+ activated K+ channels were tuned using Neurofitter (Van
Geit et al., 2007) and are presented in Anwar et al., 2010. Note that
the parameter values used for single pool in this plot are different
than those used in plot showing calcium transients. The parameter
values of single pool used to generate calcium spikes in this plot are
obtained using experimental trace (shown in Figure 1b in Anwar et al.,
2010) as a voltage command. This plot exists in Figure 7d in Anwar et
al., 2010.

4.  &lt;i&gt;Calcium spikes using double pool model:&lt;/i&gt; Click on this button to
see the calcium spikes generated using double pool model. The maximal
conductance values for P-type and T-type Ca2+ channels and BK-type and
SK-type Ca2+ activated K+ channels were tuned using Neurofitter (Van
Geit et al., 2007) and are presented in Anwar et al., 2010. Note that
the parameter values used for double pool in this plot are different
than those used in plot showing calcium transients. The parameter
values of double pool used to generate calcium spikes in this plot are
obtained using experimental trace (shown in Figure 1b in Anwar et al.,
2010) as a voltage command. This plot exists in Figure 7d in Anwar et
al., 2010.

5.  &lt;i&gt;Calcium spikes using detailed model:&lt;/i&gt; Click on this button to see
the calcium spikes generated using detailed model. The maximal
conductance values for P-type and T-type Ca2+ channels and BK-type and
SK-type Ca2+ activated K+ channels were tuned using Neurofitter (Van
Geit et al., 2007) and are presented in Anwar et al., 2010. This plot
exists in Figure 7c in Anwar et al., 2010.

6.  &lt;i&gt;Calcium spikes using DCM:&lt;/i&gt; Click on this button to see the calcium
spikes generated using DCM. The maximal conductance values for P-type
and T-type Ca2+ channels and BK-type and SK-type Ca2+ activated K+
channels were tuned using Neurofitter (Van Geit et al., 2007) and are
presented in Anwar et al., 2010. This plot exists in Figure 7c in
Anwar et al., 2010.

APthreshold.hoc	    - generates data to find action potential thresholds
                      

To generate action potential data using APthreshold.hoc:

1. Install latest pre-compiled package of NEURON (if not already installed)
   and allow it to associate .HOC files.

2. Copy these files to a working directory (eg. C:\R859C)

3. Run the NEURON mknrndll utility to compile the model files.  
   mknrndll is likely found under    Start / Programs / NEURON 
   Use the mknrndll directory selector to navigate to the folder
   where you copied these files and while in that directory choose 
   &quot;Make nrnmech.dll&quot;.  A shell window will open and you should 
   get a message saying nrnmech.dll was created.  
   
4. Double click APthreshold.hoc to execute the program using the 
   default parameters (wild-type data).  The data will be saved
   in a new file called APthreshold.txt.  (Any existing file with 
   this name will be overwritten).
   
5. To generate similar data for the R859C channels change the value 
   of the useCellType variable set near the top of the APthreshold.hoc 
   file to &quot;R859C&quot;.

   A novel mutation, R859C, in the Nav1.1 sodium channel was identified in a 4-generation, 33-member Caucasian family with a clinical presentation consistent with GEFS+. The mutation neutralizes a positively charged arginine in the domain 2 S4 voltage sensor of the Nav1.1 channel &amp;fnof;Ñ subunit. When the mutation was placed in the rat Nav1.1 channel and expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the mutant channel displayed a positive shift in the voltage-dependence of sodium channel activation, slower recovery from slow inactivation, and lower levels of current compared to the wild-type channel. Computational analysis suggests that neurons expressing the mutant channel have higher thresholds for firing a single action potential and for firing multiple action potentials, along with decreased repetitive firing. Therefore, this mutation should lead to decreased neuronal excitability, in contrast to most previous GEFS+ sodium channel mutations that have changes predicted to increase neuronal firing.References: 1.

   &lt;pre&gt;files for a NEURON implementation of the Hopfield and Brody (HB) model 
from the papers:
JJ Hopfield and CD Brody, PNAS 97, 13919 (2000)
JJ Hopfield and CD Brody, PNAS 98, 1282 (2001)
complete information about the original model can be found at:

http://str.princeton.edu/mus/Organism/

This is a custom implementation, intended to serve as a basic starting point 
for those who would like to build a more realistic network
using NEURON and the ideas underlying the HB model.

200 &quot;inputs from area A&quot; were implemented, 
composed by 40 input channels 
each of them triggering a set of 5 slowly decaying currents (40x20 in HB).
These currents were modeled as single exponential synaptic events 
with slow decays of 200,300,400,500, and 600ms, respectively,
rather than as linearly decreasing generic currents as in HB.
Each synaptic current was delivered to one Alpha and one Beta &quot;area W&quot; neurons.

The 200 Alpha + 200 Beta area W neurons 
were modeled as a single compartment neurons with Na+ and K+ currents 
from a CA1 model (see the CA1 model on the Senselab website) 
rather than with Leaky Integrate and Fire cells (HB). 

To &quot;train&quot; the network to recognize 
the event times pattern from the &quot;exemplar.txt&quot; file (that can be 
found at the HB website),
30 Alpha and Beta cells (listed in the connections.txt file)
whose firing rates were approximately converging
after about 400ms were selected for all-to-all connections. 

Since the network recognizes only one pattern, only one Gamma cell was used.

Membrane time constants were the same as in HB.

To run the simulations

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui hopfield-brody_sd.hoc

Under Windows:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll DOS box&quot; and 
follow on-screen instructions.
A double click on the simulation file
hopfield-brody_sd.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Three simulations could be run to show the output of the Gamma cell, a raster 
plot,
and firing rates of the selected Alpha cells when an input pattern was presented
under three different conditions:

&quot;before training&quot;: event times pattern from &quot;exemplar.txt&quot; 
		   and no connections among the area W cells;
&quot;after training&quot; : event times pattern from &quot;exemplar.txt&quot; 
		   and all-to-all connections between the selected cells;
		   Note firing synchronization on the raster (red marks)
		   and firing rate plots (bold lines).
&quot;random activation&quot;: random event times pattern
		   and all-to-all connections between the selected cells;

On a 1.3GHz pentium IV under Windows2000 each simulation (1sec of model time)
needs about 2.5min of CPU time.

L5b pyramidal cells have been the subject of extensive experimental and modeling studies, yet conductance-based models of these cells that faithfully reproduce both their perisomatic Na+-spiking behavior as well as key dendritic active properties, including Ca2+ spikes and back-propagating action potentials, are still lacking.

Based on a large body of experimental recordings from both the soma and dendrites of L5b pyramidal cells in adult rats, we characterized key features of the somatic and dendritic firing and quantified their statistics.

We used these features to constrain the density of a set of ion channels over the soma and dendritic surface via multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary algorithm, thus generating a set of detailed conductance-based models that faithfully replicate the back-propagating action potential activated Ca2+ spike firing and the perisomatic firing response to current steps, as well as the experimental variability of the properties.

The models we present provide several experimentally-testable predictions and can serve as a powerful tool for theoretical investigations of the contribution of single-cell dynamics to network activity and its computational capabilities.

This model of cardiac sarcomere dynamics linked to calcium kinetics is implemented and
modified for Neuron by Francois E. Gannier and Claire O. Malecot 
	from University of Tours - FRANCE
	Physiologie des Cellules Cardiaques et Vasculaires
	email address: francois.gannier@univ-tours.fr

It is based on the paper by :
Negroni JA &amp; Lascano EC (1996) A cardiac muscle model relating sarcomere 
dynamics to calcium kinetics. J Mol Cell Cardio 28:915-929 [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8762031&quot; target=&quot;url&quot;&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;]

this is a now classic model of contraction which has been added in some recent models 
(eg : kyoto model (2003), Okada model (2005))

it uses a four-state combination to show the relation between C-Troponin, calcium,
cross-bridges and Force.

The orginal model was modified to allow several stimuli with self-chosen frequency.
(This allows to reproduce a staircase phenomenom)
 
To run the simulation auto-launch the model from modeldb or download
and extract the archive and then compile the mod files under:

unix/linux:
-----------
type nrnivmodl in the NegroniLascano folder and then
nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin:
------
run mknrndll and then double click on mosinit.hoc

MAC OS X:
--------

Drag and drop the NegroniLascano folder onto the mknrndll icon.  Drag
and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

Once the simulation starts it recreates a figure similar to Fig. 2 (shown as three 
panels for clarity)&amp; 3 of the original paper.

   &quot;A muscle model establishing the link between cross-bridge dynamics and intracellular Ca2+ kinetics was assessed by simulation of experiments performed in isolated cardiac muscle.

The model is composed by the series arrangement of muscle units formed by inextensible thick and thin filaments in parallel with an elastic element.

Attached cross-bridges act as independent force generators whose force is linearly related to the elongation of their elastic structure.

Ca2+ kinetics is described by a four-state system of sites on the thin filament associated with troponin C: sites with free troponin C (T), sites with Ca2+ bound to troponin C (TCa); sites with Ca2+ bound to troponin C and attached cross-bridges (TCa*); and sites with troponin C not associated with Ca2+ and attached cross-bridges (T*).

The intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) is controlled solely by the sarcoplasmic reticulum through an inflow function and a saturated outflow pump function.

   &lt;pre&gt;Synaptic Integration in a CA1 Pyramidal Cell
--------------------------------------------

This model investigates signal integration in the dendritic tree
of a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell when different combinations
of active channels are present in the tree.  The model is the
basis of the results presented in the paper:

Bruce P. Graham, Pattern recognition in a compartmental model of
a CA1 pyramidal neuron, Network: Computation in Neural Systems
12: 473-492, 2001.

The model allows the user to specify the number of synapses that
are randomly distributed across the portion of the apical dendritic
tree that is in stratum radiatum (default 200 synapses).  The total
synaptic conductance and the relative proportions of AMPA and NMDA
response at a single synapse can also be specified. 

Running the model gives the voltage response at the soma as the
result of synaptic events at all of the synapses.  These events
are either synchronous, or randomly spread in time according to
the &quot;temporal jitter&quot; interval.

Various combinations of active channels can be added to the
dendritic tree via menu options.  The default configuration adds
all the available channels to the tree in the proportions used
in the paper.  Details of other combinations and exactly how the
channels are distributed across the tree (non-uniform) are given
in the paper.

Abstract

Background: Previous one-dimensional network modeling of the
cerebellar granular layer has been successfully linked with a range of
cerebellar cortex oscillations observed in vivo. However, the recent
discovery of gap junctions between Golgi cells (GoCs), which may cause
oscillations by themselves, has raised the question of how
gap-junction coupling affects GoC and granular-layer oscillations. To
investigate this question, we developed a novel two-dimensional
computational model of the GoC-granule cell (GC) circuit with and
without gap junctions between GoCs.Results: Isolated GoCs coupled by
gap junctions had a strong tendency to generate spontaneous
oscillations without affecting their mean firing frequencies in
response to distributed mossy fiber input. Conversely, when GoCs were
synaptically connected in the granular layer, gap junctions increased
the power of the oscillations, but the oscillations were primarily
driven by the synaptic feedback loop between GoCs and GCs, and the gap
junctions did not change oscillation frequency or the mean firing rate
of either GoCs or GCs.Conclusion: Our modeling results suggest that
gap junctions between GoCs increase the robustness of cerebellar
cortex oscillations that are primarily driven by the feedback loop
between GoCs and GCs. The robustness effect of gap junctions on
synaptically driven oscillations observed in our model may be a
general mechanism, also present in other regions of the brain.

   This is a model of neurons in the brainstem superior paraolivary nucleus (SPN), which produce very salient offset firing during sound stimulation. Rebound offset firing is triggered by IPSPs coming from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). This model shows that AP firing can emerge from inhibition through integration of large IPSPs, driven by an
extremely negative chloride reversal potential, combined with a large hyperpolarization-
activated non-specific cationic current (IH), with a secondary contribution from a T-type calcium conductance (ITCa). As a result, tiny gaps in sound stimuli of just 3-4ms can elicit reliable APs that signal such brief offsets.Reference: Kopp-Scheinpflug C, Tozer AJB, Robinson SW,Tempel BL, Hennig MH, Forsythe ID (2011) The Sound of Silence: ionic mechanisms encoding sound termination  71(5):911-925

  <description>
   The model of type II cochlear ganglion cell was based on the
immunostaining of the mouse auditory pathway. Specific antibodies were
used to map the distribution of voltage-dependent sodium channels along
the two unmyelinated axon-like processes of the bipolar ganglion cells.
Three distinct hot spots were detected. A high density of sodium
channels was present over the entire trajectory of sensory endings
beneath the outer hair cells (the most distal portion of the peripheral
axon). THE other two hot spots were localized in the initial segments of
both of the axons that flank the unmyelinated bipolar ganglion cell bodies.

A biophysical model indicates that all three hot spots might play
important roles in action potential initiation and propagation. For
instance, the hot spot in the receptor segment is important for
transforming the receptor potentials into a full blown action potential
(Supplemental Fig. 1). The hot spots in the two paraganglionic axon
initial segments are there to ensure the successful propagation of
action potentials from the peripheral to the central axon through the
cell body.

There are key unresolved differences between the published model and
the NEURON implementation.

The published model's damped oscillations occur when the low- to
moderate- amplitude depolarizing currents are injected; in the NEURON
implementation, they are triggered by low-amplitude hyperpolarizing
currents.

The published model responds fairley linearly to a wide range of
hyperpolarizing currents; the NEURON implementation shows a quite
nonlinear jump to negative membrane potentials when medium to large
hyperpolarizing currents are injected.

The published model's resting potential is 0; the resting potential of
the NEURON implementation is nonzero and nonuniform. The NEURON
implementation's resting potential can be forced to zero everywhere by
adjusting e_pas in each compartment so that i_pas cancels out the
contributions of local Na and K currents; however, the resulting
model's responses to injected depolarizing and hyperpolarizing
currents diverge even more from those of the published model.

Moreover,there is still an unresolved issue concerning the time
constants.  According to Borst, these are not scaled/normalized in
figure 8 (f,g) from the 1997 paper. This implies that our time
constants are tau_max times to large.

When contacted, Borst was positive about the constructed model.  The
discrepancies are likely due to (1) the morphology and (2) the
distribution of the voltage-gated channels.  Recall that (i) the
morphology is coming from neuromorpho.org; a curated database in which
they &quot;repair&quot; morphologies.  A different morphology leads to a
different outcome (especially since the tiny branches are close to the
axon).  (ii) the description of the location of the voltage-gated
channels is rather vague.  Clearly this may effect the outcome as
well.  (Qualitatively the results are similar, quantitatively, there
are some discrepancies).

   In a series of papers the authors conducted experiments to develop understanding and models of fly visual system HS, CS, and VS neurons.  This model recreates the VS neurons from those papers with enough success to merit approval by Borst although some discrepancies remain (see readme).References: 1.

Different kinetics are used for proximal and distal dendritic 
KA channels, with increasing density with distance from the soma.
The kinetics for the Na conductance includes a gate variable 
for the slow inactivation.

To compile the mod files on a unix system use the command nrnivmodl.
Under Windows use the &quot;mknrndll DOS box&quot; from the NEURON program menu
and follow on-screen instructions.

running the simulation hoc files with the command

nrngui fig_1a.hoc
or
nrngui fig_1c.hoc

will generate the simulations shown in Fig.1A and Fig.1C of the
paper, respectively.

   The model demonstrates that CA1 pyramidal neurons support rebound spikes mediated by hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih), and normally masked by A-type potassium channels (KA). Partial KA reduction confined to one or few branches of the apical tuft may be sufficient to elicit a local spike following a train of synaptic inhibition. These data suggest that the plastic regulation of KA can provide a dynamic switch to unmask post-inhibitory spiking in CA1 pyramidal neurons, further increasing the signal processing power of the CA1 synaptic microcircuitry.Reference: Ascoli GA, Gasparini S, Medinilla V, Migliore M (2010) Local Control of Post-Inhibitory Rebound Spiking in CA1 Pyramidal Neuron Dendrites  30(18):6434-42

Based on voltage-clamp recordings of NMDA receptor-mediated currents in

this model was fit with AxoGraph directly to experimental recordings in order
to obtain the optimal values for the parameters.

The model illustrates and explains bistable spatial pattern of the current transfer effectiveness 
in the active dendrite with distributed (multiple) tonic excitatory, NMDA type, synaptic input. 
Introducing steady synaptic conductivity of uniform maximum value in the dendritic membrane
simulates such input. 
With increasing membrane depolarization the voltage-dependent NMDA synaptic conductivity
increases and becomes dominating in the total conductivity (Fig.1A). Correspondingly,
the effective equilibrium potential shifts from the resting level to nearly equilibrium potential 
of the excitatory synaptic current (Fig.1B). Due to such voltage dependence of NMDA 
conductivity the dendritic membrane is non-linear with N-shaped steady current-voltage (I-V) 
relation (Fig.1C). 
This makes the neuron electrically bistabile with one stable state of the membrane potential close 
to the resting level (downstate) and another one (upstate) close to the equilibrium potential of 
excitatory synaptic current (Fig.2 A and B, respectively).
Fig.3, A-D shows how such membrane properties define bistable contribution from various 
dendritic sites to the total current transferred to the soma during tonic NMDA excitation. 
For that the NEURON programs compute and display the path profiles of the membrane 
voltage and effective equilibrium potential (A), total and partial conductivities (B), 
total current per unit membrane area (C) and the core current increment per unit path length (D). 
The latter is the estimate of the current transfer effectiveness as described in: 

                 Korogod SM and Kulagina IB (1998) Biol Cybern 79: 231-242

Tonic dendritic depolarization in both states was the greatest on the distal tip and decayed 
toward the soma. The upstate and downstate dendritic depolarizations were in the range of, 
respectively, positive and negative slope of the N-shaped local I-V relation. Correspondingly, 
in the upstate, more depolarized distal dendritic sites produced smaller (almost zero at the tip) 
current density and smaller contribution to the somatopetal core current than proximal ones. 
An unusual effect was observed in the downstate: more depolarized distal sites were 
more effective than proximal ones.

PasSA.mod: passive membrane current of the soma and axon

In this paper, the model revealed that the gating changes introduced
by a mutation in K(v)7.2 genes encoding for the neuronal KM current in
a case of benign familial neonatal seizures, increased cell firing
frequency, thereby triggering the neuronal hyperexcitability which
underlies the observed neonatal epileptic condition.  The fig6a.hoc

In this paper, the model revealed that the gating changes introduced by a mutation in K(v)7.2 
genes encoding for the neuronal KM current in a case of benign familial neonatal seizures,
increased cell firing frequency, thereby triggering the neuronal hyperexcitability which underlies the observed neonatal epileptic condition.

Abstract:
Ionic conductances underlying excitability in tonically firing neurons
(TFNs) from substantia gelatinosa (SG) were studied by the patch-clamp
method in rat spinal cord slices.  Ca2+-dependent K+ (KCA) conductance
sensitive to apamin was found to prolong the interspike intervals and
stabilize firing evoked by a sustained membrane
depolarization. Suppression of Ca2+ and KCA currents, however, did not
abolish the basic pattern of tonic firing, indicating that it was
generated by voltage-gated Na+ and K+ currents.  Na+ and K+ channels
were further analyzed in somatic nucleated patches. Na+ channels
exhibited fast activation and inactivation kinetics and followed
two-exponential time course of recovery from inactivation. The major
K+ current was carried through tetraethylammonium (TEA)-sensitive
rapidly activating delayed-rectifier (KDR) channels with a slow
inactivation. The TEA-insensitive transient A-type K+ (KA) current was
very small in patches and was strongly inactivated at resting
potential. Block of KDR rather than KA conductance by 1 mM TEA lowered
the frequency and stability of firing.  Intracellular staining with
biocytin revealed at least three morphological groups of
TFNs. Finally, on the basis of present data, we created a model of TFN
and showed that Na+ and KDR currents are sufficient to generate a
basic pattern of tonic firing. It is concluded that the balanced
contribution of all ionic conductances described here is important for
generation and modulation of tonic firing in SG neurons.

How to run model:

Auto-launch from ModelDB (if NEURON is installed)

or

download and extract archive and compile the mod files with
mknrndll (mswin or MAC), nrnivmodl (unix/linux).  Then start
with nrngui mosinit.hoc (linux) or by double clicking mosinit.hoc
(mswin)

------------------------------
Once the model has started press Init&amp;Run; to generate fig 7A (left).
Click on the IClamp button and adjust the current to 0.030 nA
and press Init&amp;Run; for the middle fig 7A, and then 0.12 nA and press
Init&amp;Run; for fig 7A (right).

Melnick IV, Santos SF, Safronov BV (2004)
Mechanism of spike frequency adaptation in substantia gelatinosa
neurones of rat. J Physiol 559:383-95 

Abstract: 
Using tight-seal recordings from rat spinal cord slices,
intracellular labelling and computer simulation, we analysed the 
mechanisms of spike frequency adaptation in substantia gelatinosa
(SG) neurones. Adapting-firing neurones (AFNs) generated short 
bursts of spikes during sustained depolarization and were mostly 
found in lateral SG. The firing pattern and the shape of single 
spikes did not change after substitution of Ca2+ with Co2+ , 
Mg2+ or Cd2+ indicating that Ca2+ -dependent conductances do not 
contribute to adapting firing.  Transient KA current was small
and completely inactivated at resting potential suggesting that 
adapting firing was mainly generated by voltage-gated Na+ and 
delayed-rectifier K+ (KDR ) currents. Although these currents
were similar to those previously described in tonic-firing
neurones (TFNs), we found that Na+ and KDR currents were smaller 
in AFNs. Discharge pattern in TFNs could be reversibly converted 
into that typical of AFNs in the presence of tetrodotoxin but not
tetraethylammonium, suggesting that lower Na+ conductance is more
critical for the appearance of firing adaptation. Intracellularly
labelled AFNs showed specific morphological features and
preserved long extensively branching axons, indicating that 
smaller Na+ conductance could not result from the axon cut. 
Computer simulation has further revealed that down-regulation of
Na+ conductance represents an effective mechanism for the
induction of firing adaptation. It is suggested that the 
cell-specific regulation of Na+ channel expression can be an 
important factor underlying the diversity of firing patterns in
SG neurones.

Although the current simulation does not exactly reproduce Figure
7 from the paper (for some unknown reason), the general result of
the paper is supported; the appearance of spike frequency
adaptation can be attributed to modulation of Na channels, either
through their overall expression (lessening Na channel max
conductance gbar_B_Na in the hillock of the model), or shifts in
either the activation or inactivation functions of Na channels 
throughout the neuron.

Figure 7:

Note the first and fourth columns in figure 7 shows tonic firing
with the other columns showing ways to find adaptive firing by
the changes mentioned above.

Sample explorations of the model:

Change gnabar_B_Na in the hillock window to the value 1.8 (S/cm2)
Press Init &amp; Run
This demonstrates tonic firing.

Decreasing gnabar_B_Na to 0.73 then shows only a single spike is
generated.

Typing at the oc&amp;gt; prompt
alpha_shift_B_Na = -3 
then restores the tonic firing.

Exploring the fifth column by setting gnabar_B_Na = 0.521 S/cm2
at the hillock and typing at the oc&amp;gt; prompt
alpha_shift_B_Na = 5
beta_shift_B_Na = 11

and set the current (click the IClamp button and set amp =0.50)
Pressing Init &amp; Run then generates a figure like

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=62284&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\ba\Fig7col5_i50.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sample run&quot; /&gt;

Additional note:
In all my models a temperature 6.3 corresponds to a room 
temperature of 22-24 C, and motoneuron model with 20.3 (6.3 + 14)
corresponds to 36-38 C.

  journal = 	&quot;J Computational Neuroscience&quot;,
  year = 	&quot;1994&quot;,
  volume = 	&quot;1&quot;,
  pages = 	&quot;39-60&quot;,

The simulation provided will create 3 graphs: 
  Fig. 3 using Neuron (upper left)
  Fig. 3 using xppaut (upper right)
  Fig. 2A using Neuron (black) and xppaut (red) -- xppaut is same as in journal
The xppaut results are read into Neuron from a data file.  

The correct simulation is available in the download as booth_bose.ode
This program can be run under Bard Ermentraut's simulator xppaut 
                http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html
The booth_bose.ode provided here is slightly modified from the original obtained
from Victoria Booth's home page; the originals include more extensive simulations:
                http://www.math.njit.edu/~vbooth/

I have not perfectly replicated the simulation: the morphology of the bursts are
very close to being correct but the timing of bursts in the 1500 ms simulation is 
off (as can be seen by zooming in on the final burst). This is due to the precise
timing of threshold crossings (see next paragraph).   The data for the xppaut, 
accurate replica is provided in xpp.dat.  The columns are 't vs vd cad hs ns sd cd
qd gkq gkc'.  The first 3 state variables from this data file are opened in Neuron
by vectors of the same name (time is in tvec).

The difficulty in porting this program to Neuron can be seen by looking at the
FInitializeHandler and nafPR.mod.  In the hoc file, we unset state variables (set
to zero) using FInitializeHandler(&quot;unset()&quot;).  Notice that even h_nafPR, which
would typically be set to a value near 1 to start (ie sodium channel fully
deinactivated) is set to 0 and must therefore gradually relax to 1 during the
first few ms of the simulation.  In nafPR.mod, we see that the sodium conductance
is not dependent on state variable 'm' but instead on the steady-state value
'minf'.  Here I found that I got different results depending on my implementation
of nafPR.  Another likely location for differences in the simulations arises in
the handling of the thresholds for the calcium-sensitive potassium channels.  Iahp
(here called rkq under Neuron -- historical -- and Kahp under xppaut) has
discontinuity at a Ca (chi) level of 500 ('min(0.00002*Cad,0.01)' in
booth_bose.ode); Kc (kcRT03 bzw. KC) at 250 -- 'min(Cad/250.0,1.0)'.  Precise
simulation results depend on exactly when these are handled.

I'm sure that these limitations can be overcome but I suspect that it would
require looking closely at the BREAKPOINT mechanism to make sure that values are
made available at the same time step in both xppaut and Neuron (both simulations
are using CVODE/CVODES)

I also have not incorporated the 'p' variable which sets the dendrite/soma
area ratio.  It is called pp and set to 0.5 but not incorporated in the geometry
setting routines.

PLoS ONE 4(9): e6970. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0006970  

These NEURON model files were contributed by Rodrigo Publio.

Recent works suggest that one of the roles of gap junctions in sensory
systems is to enhance their dynamic range by avoiding early saturation
in the first processing stages. In this work, we use a minimal
conductance-based model of the ON rod pathways in the vertebrate
retina to study the effects of electrical synaptic coupling via gap
junctions among rods and among AII amacrine cells on the dynamic range
of the retina. The model is also used to study the effects of the
maximum conductance of rod hyperpolarization activated current Ih on
the dynamic range of the retina, allowing a study of the
interrelations between this intrinsic membrane parameter with those
two retina connectivity characteristics. Our results show that for
realistic values of Ih conductance the dynamic range is enhanced by
rod-rod coupling, and that AII-AII coupling is less relevant to
dynamic range amplification in comparison with receptor
coupling. Furthermore, a plot of the retina output response versus
input intensity for the optimal parameter configuration is well fitted
by a power law with exponent ~0.5. The results are consistent with
predictions of more theoretical works and suggest that the earliest
expression of gap junctions along the rod pathways, together with
appropriate values of rod Ih conductance, has the highest impact on
vertebrate retina dynamic range enhancement.  ~

Figures 1 of &quot;A Computational Study on the Role of Gap Junctions and
Rod Ih Conductance in the Enhancement of the Dynamic Range of the
Retina&quot; can be replicated with this code, for example:

After compiling all MOD files load the appropriate HOC file (init.hoc)
from the neuron main menu after starting nrngui or by either double
clicking in mswin's window explorer, typing nrngui init.hoc in unix,
or dragging and dropping the init.hoc file onto the nrngui icon in Mac
OS X. Session files are called by the main HOC file.

The network dimensions and synaptic convergence/divergence are
specified at the parameters.hoc file. The cells are created from
templates at the createcells.hoc while gap junctions and chemical
synapses are created at netconnection.hoc.

This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:

Carnevale-Hines integration scheme for integrate-and-fire models', 
Neural Computation, July 2009, Vol. 21, No. 7: 1913-1930. 
(doi:10.1162/neco.2009.07-08-815 )

Files:

Actual implementation of the generalized IntFire4 mechanism, called
	IntFire4r: intfire4r.mod
	
Hoc-file defining a network of IntFire4r cells: IF4rNetwork.hoc
	
Session files bringing up a little GUI for plotting model behavior in
4 different initial conditions:
	IF4rFigures.hoc

Execution:

After compilation of intfire4r.mod (mknrndll with PC and MAC,
nrnivmodl under linux) run IF4rFigures.hoc in NEURON. This will load
intfire4r cells and bring up a panel with four choices ++,+-,-+,-- and
three graphs. The first+/- indicates whether the model starts with a
positive (+) or negative (-) dm/dt, the second +/- indicates whether
the model starts above (+) or below (-) m=0. The graphs show the
currents e (E), i2 (I) and the membrane potential m (M).

For example running &quot;++&quot; will generate figures such as:

This model reproduces figures 2 and 3.
The standard temperature for the conductance Q10's is not specified
in the paper. However, fig 3 seems to give quantitatively similar results
when the choice for the &quot;All Q10's&quot; curve is a standard temperature of 0 degC.

The NEURON implementation of this model was prepared by Michael Hines.

Coupling Generate High Frequency Oscillations in a Hippocampal
Computational Model.  Journal of neurophysiology 102: 2342-2357, 2009.



To run the simulation
---------------------

1. Should be run in the normal (serial) installation of NEURON 6.1 or
above.  Most of the code is actually written for parallel
implementation, but several functions were added that are not able to
run in parallel.

2. Unpack the zip file, keeping the file structure intact (see below)

3. Compile the nrnmech file within the \mod directory according to
your system's requirements.  Move the nrnmech file to the root
directory.

4. Run netrun.hoc.

5. Currently the network creates the three files demonstrated in
Fig. 5A.  Other specific parameters to simulate different conditions
need to be set as follows :

        within netrun.hoc

                Tstop           length of simulation in ms
                pyrthr          the threshold to which the random
                                number (0-100) is compared.  rnd &amp;gt;
                                pyrthr will create a noise event
                basketthr       same as above for synapses to basket
                                cells
                gapstyle        whenever you alter the files in
                                \parameters, change this number and
                                record what the changes were
                sigfreq                frequency of periodic signal.  Will
                                have to be placed with 
                                pr.signalSynapse(Tstop, 0, sigfreq, 
                                cell#that_receives_stim).  Cells 
                                0-80 are the pyramidal cells
        
        within \parameters\conn.dat

                this file lists all synaptic and gap junctional
                connections, based on the parameters of synapses.par
                the current conn.dat has the full feedback network of
                pyr - basket - pyr connections described.  It also has
                gap junctions between the basket cells (but these are
                currently &quot;turned off&quot; because the conductance is 0 in
                synapses.par) there are several additional conn.dat
                files in the attached folder.  These simply need to be
                moved to the \parameters directory and renamed
                &quot;conn.dat&quot;

        \parameters\synapses.par
                
                Here the gmax of the synapses is changed.  For Figure
                5B, the &quot;5.5&quot; in the &quot;Bask, Pyr&quot; line was changed to
                various levels. NOTE: that due to scaling, this gmax
                is divided by 20 in the network, thus &quot;5.5&quot; is
                actually 0.275 nS I did not change the amplitude of
                any other &quot;synapses&quot; (noise was altered by rate of
                firing, not amplitude) The gap junctions at the end
                have altered gmax in the same fashion.  In this case
                there is no scaling, and the gmax's indicated are what
                are reported.

FILE EXPLANATIONS
=================

Program run in the root directory, and calls files in several branched
directories as listed below.  The program is run from a batch file
that saves several parameters into the file names

Note that the program was originally written in parallel format, and
is based on legacy code written by Maciej Lazarewicz that was some of
the first parallel code used in NEURON, before the parallel version
was out of alpha.  There have been many modifications since then, some
of which do not work in parallel.  It is for this reason that the gap
junctions were done with the parallel format directly in the TGnet.tem
rather than the pointer method.

Unfortunately, the parallel idiom, which is slightly different even
than the current standard parallel idiom, can make this code difficult
to follow.  Because of several reasons, this code is not ready for
parallel implementation.  However, it is an excellent candidate for
the &quot;bulletin board&quot; style parallel that is currently being developed.
        

root folders:
        
        \templates

                ****TGnet.tem  //main program to build the network and
                    generate stimuli and noise 
                ****PYRkop.tem //template for the pyramidal cells 
                ****Bwb.tem    //template for basket cells
                Ok.tem         // Okn cells not used
                several others //not used

        \mod
                has all the channels, synapses, and gap(not used) .mod
                files
                
        \parameters

                // this folder is where the connectivity and
                conductance values are changed for different runs has
                .dat and .par files that contain the parameters that
                will be read in These files must be manually altered
                to change the parameters.  I used the parameter
                &quot;gapstyle&quot; in the netrun.hoc to indicate which
                parameter set I had used for gmax's (had to keep track
                of this separately&quot; also have .tem files for cells and
                synapses

        \library
                //not used
        \data
                // all data saved here.  Each run creates a different
                filename to be saved


The main folder has the .hoc executable (there are many different
versions, all variations of below)
          *****netrun.hoc   //main .hoc file
                loads in /templates/TGnet.tem
                sets many flags and parameters
                DoRun() is the main executable

                        pr = new TGnet() //from template folder which
                                contains all functions in TGnet.tem,
                                as well as having .pnm. class
                        pr.pnm.want_all_spikes()
                        pr.activeSynapsesRandom(.....)  generates
                                random synaptic events in all the
                                cells
                        pr.signalSynapse(....)  adds a periodic input
                                to a specific pyramidal cell
                        pr.pnm.psolve(Tstop)
                        pr.pnm.gatherspikes()
                        writes files per flags
                        pr.pnm.pc.gid_clear()

                I make runs of files by changing parameters then
                calling DoRun(), over and over


Note that, although written in pnm.pc format, I have never compiled
NEURON that way--I've just run it in basic serial format.

  <description>
   &quot;... Using a physiological computer model of hippocampus, we investigate random synaptic activity
(noise) as a potential initiator of HFOs (high-frequency oscillations).

We explore parameters necessary to produce these oscillations and quantify the response
using the tools of stochastic resonance (SR) and coherence resonance
(CR).
... 

Our results show that, under normal coupling conditions, synaptic noise was able to produce
gamma (30&amp;ndash;100 Hz) frequency oscillations.


Synaptic noise generated HFOs in the ripple range (100&amp;ndash;200 Hz) when the network had
parameters similar to pathological findings in epilepsy: increased gap
junctions or recurrent synaptic connections, loss of inhibitory interneurons
such as basket cells, and increased synaptic noise.

...
We propose that increased synaptic noise and physiological coupling mechanisms are sufficient to generate gamma
oscillations and that pathologic changes in noise and coupling similar
to those in epilepsy can produce abnormal ripples.&quot;

This model qualitatively reproduces figures 2,3,4,5 and,
to a lesser extent, fig 7.
It is entirely possible that I misinterpreted  the meaning of figure 7 as
a plot of separately integrated positive and negative total membrane current.
Such a plot shows much less &quot;charge transfer&quot; in the proximal region of
the wire than is shown in the paper figure.
I attribute other discrepancies to the precise recording locations and the
details of spatial discretization.

The NEURON implementation of this model was prepared by Michael Hines.
Questions about details of this implementation should be addressed to him
at michael.hines@yale.edu.

   From the paper abstract: An impulse ... sees an increased electrical load at regions of increasing diameter or at branch points with certain morphologies. We present here theoretical and experimental studies on the changes in membrane current and axial current associated with diameter changes. The theoretical studies were done with numerical solutions for cable equations that were generalized to include a varying diameter; the Hodgkin-Huxley equations were used to represent the membrane properties. ... As an action potential approaches a region of increased electrical load, the action potential amplitude and rate of rise decrease, but there is a marked increase in the magnitude of the inward sodium current. ...

  <description>
   In Destexhe, Neubig, Ulrich, and Huguenard (1998) experiments and models examine low threshold calcium current's (IT, or T-current) distribution in thalamocortical (TC) cells.  Multicompartmental modeling supports the hypothesis that IT currents have a density at least several fold higher in the dendrites than the soma.  The IT current contributes significantly to rebound bursts and is thought to have important network behavior consequences.  See the paper for details.

This package is running with the NEURON simulation program written by Michael
Hines and available on internet at:
  http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/
  http://neuron.duke.edu/

The package contains mechanisms (.mod files) and programs (.oc files) needed
to simulate networks of thalamic reticular (RE) neurons interacting with
inhibitory synapses.  The approach followed here uses the object-oriented
facilities of NEURON to simulate networks, and can be applied to other types
of neurons and/or other types of synaptic interactions.  

This model studies the genesis of 10Hz oscillations by inhibitory networks of
RE neurons in the thalamus.  Each neuron is described by a single-compartment
containing voltage- and calcium-dependent currents described by Hodgkin-Huxley
type of model.  Synaptic interactions are handled by kinetic models of
postsynaptic receptors of the GABA_A and GABA_B types.  

The models given here are described in detail in the following paper:

  Destexhe, A., Contreras, D., Sejnowski, T.J. and Steriade, M.  
  A model of spindle rhythmicity in the isolated thalamic reticular nucleus. 
  Journal of Neurophysiology, 72: 803-818, 1994.

A postscript version of this paper, including figures, is available on
internet at 
  http://cns.iaf.cnrs-gif.fr/Main.html
  
  PROGRAMS
  ========

Each program reproduces one figure of the paper:

Fig5A.hoc  :  2 neurons connected with GABA_A synapses
Fig5B.hoc  :  2 neurons connected with GABA_A synapses + self-connections
Fig6A.hoc  :  5 neurons connected with GABA_A synapses (first-neighbor)
Fig6B.hoc  :  5 neurons connected with GABA_A synapses (first-neighbor+self)
Fig6C.hoc  :  5 neurons connected with GABA_A synapses (2nd-neighbor)
Fig6D.hoc  :  5 neurons connected with GABA_A synapses (all-to-all)
Fig13A.hoc :  2 neurons connected with GABA_B synapses
Fig13B.hoc :  2 neurons connected with GABA_B synapses + self-connections


  MECHANISMS
  ==========

HH2.mod         : Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics for action potentials
IT2.mod         : low-threshold calcium current of thalamic RE neurons
IAHP.mod        : calcium-activated K+ current responsible for AHP
ICAN.mod        : calcium-activated nonspecific cation current
capump.mod      : calcium clearance mechanisms

gaba.mod        : two-state kinetic model for GABA_A receptors
gabab1.mod      : two-state kinetic model for GABA_B receptors


  HOW TO RUN
  ==========

Use autolaunch on modeldb or:

unix platform:

  To compile the demo, NEURON and INTERVIEWS must be installed and working on
  the machine you are using.  Just type &quot;nrnivmodl&quot; to compile the mechanisms
  given in the mod files.

  Then, execute the main demo program by typing:

The NEURON files are the basis for the figure 2b in Bahmer A, 
Langner G (2007) The matlab files for the Chopper neurons (Topology I and II
correspond to Bahmer and Langner 2006 I II

Usage:

NEURON_Chopper_Network_Simulation:

Either Auto-launch from ModelDB or 
--------------------
1) download and extract the archive.
2) compile the mod files

   unix/linux: use the nrnivmod command in the
   NEURON_Chopper_Network_Simulation folder

   mswin: use mknrndll to compile the mode files in the
   NEURON_Chopper_Network_Simulation folder

   mac OS X: drag and drop the NEURON_Chopper_Network_Simulation
   folder on the mknrndll icon
3) run the simulation by

   unix/linux: type nrngui mosinit.hoc in the
   NEURON_Chopper_Network_Simulation folder.

   mswin: double click on mosinit.hoc in the
   NEURON_Chopper_Network_Simulation folder

   mac OS X: drag and drop the NEURON_Chopper_Network_Simulation
   folder on the nrngui icon.
--------------------

Now that the simulation is running you can recreate the figure 2b in
the paper by clicking on the &quot;Run&quot; button above the &quot;save matrix&quot;
button&quot;.  The simulation runs 20 times.  Then press the &quot;save matrix&quot;
button.  This saves the traces in rothman.txt for later analysis and
graphing in matlab with the import_matlab.m script. Please erase the
first line in &quot;rothman.txt&quot; by hand for the import_matlab.m script.

General description of script contents:

circuitroth120pA.ses: Network of two chopper neurons.

loop.hoc: Loops the network with increasing input strength. The file
has to be loaded within the circuitroth120pA Session from the GUI. A
matrix can be saved in a file &quot;rothman.txt&quot;. This file can be read in
matlab with &quot;import_matlab.m&quot; (after it's first line is erased)

More matlab notes:

In addition in the &quot;include&quot; folder there are function files which are
the neurons and synapses and some other files that are needed for the
simulation.  The interface for the nerve and the onset simulation is
open:

&quot;anft&quot; is the variable for the nerve input (example:
000205010020033...  sampling 25us). As it is presumed that the chopper
have an input of a frequency channel with 5 synapses it is
subdivided. (anft==5 anft==4...)

&quot;onsett&quot; is the variable for the onset neuron input. (only zeros and
ones, example: 001000010000) Onset neuron is from Rothman and Manis
(which is also stored in ModelDB).

Good test choices are anft as long as onsett, anft can contain numbers
up to 5, onsett only 1 and 0, like:

anft=  [1 1 0 0 3 5 4 1 0 0 5 4 3 0]
onsett=[0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0]


The LIF neurons have a stochastic component.

In my simulations, I have simulated the nerve and onset neuron with
many repetitions (the nerve contains stochastic elements) and stored
it. The data was a matrix, in which each colomns are time slits and
rows are one repetition with 25 us precision.  The next step was that
matlab reads one line of nerv ( number for amount of APs and zeros)
and onset (just zeros and ones, ones for an AP) and then simulates the
choppers and stores the chopper result.  This step was repeated as
often as the number of repetions.

Update 2008-07-04:
For a graphical user interface: with the compiler toolbox from matlab
we made a standalone exe-file provided in the distrib subfolder in the
ModelDB (expanded) archive but you have to install a &quot;MCR-installer&quot;
(free) which I also provide on my homepage (sorry it is in german)

   &quot;Based on the physiological and anatomical data, we propose a model consisting of a minimum network of two choppers that are interconnected with a synaptic delay of 0.4 ms (Bahmer and Langner 2006a) . Such minimum delays have been found in different systems and in various animals (e.g. Hackett, Jackson, and Rubel 1982; Borst, Helmchen, and Sakmann 1995). The choppers receive input from both the auditory nerve and an onset neuron. This model can reproduce the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation of the ISI and the dynamic features of AM coding of choppers.&quot;References: 1.

Front. Syn. Neurosci. 2:1. doi:10.3389/neuro.19.001.2010

The simulation file develop.hoc reproduces the simulations shown in
Fig.7 of the paper.

Questions on how to use this model should be directed to
michele.migliore@pa.ibf.cnr.it

Example use:

Start the model by auto-launching from ModelDB or: download and
extract the archive and compile the mod files using mknrndll (windows,
mac OS X), or nrnivmodl (linux/unix) and then start by double clicking
the mosinit.hoc (windows), dragging and dropping the mosinit.hoc onto
the nrngui icon (mac OS X), or typing &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot;
(linux/unix).

When the simulation is started press the appropriate button to run
under particular conditions to produce graphs as in Figure 7.  To get
exactly the same traces for each panel in the figure one has to start
the simulation from the beginning every time (to seed the random
number generator).  In the below only the first figure was started
from the beginning and therefore matches the paper while the others
are similar:

Glutamate at 20 Hertz:

Glutamate at 40 Hertz:

   In this review some of the recent work carried out in our laboratory concerning the functional
role of GABAergic signalling at immature mossy fibres (MF)-CA3 principal cell synapses has
been highlighted. To compare the relative strength of CA3 pyramidal cell
output in relation to their MF glutamatergic or GABAergic inputs in postnatal
development, a realistic model was constructed taking into account the different
biophysical properties of these synapses.

Running the kinetics.hoc simulation file will show 
the activation and inactivation steady-states, the time constants, 
and a family of curves generated modeling the same protocols 
used for Figs.6A-10A of the paper.

Note that although m^4*h (for I-A) was used in the 
paper to model the specific time course of current traces 
obtained from one cell (Fig.15), m*h was found to give better
results for the experimental protocol shown in Fig.6A
and better agreement with fig.5C.  
The voltage dependence for the time constants was
based on the values reported in the paper to 
to fit specific current traces (Fig.11 and Fig.15),
which are plotted with markers here.
No inactivation is implemented for K-DR.
Kinetics of Layer I neurons were reported not to be significantly 
different from Layer II/III pyramidal neurons.

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui kinetics.hoc

Under Windows using NEURON 5.1:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
kinetics.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Questions on the model parameters should be directed to the 
authors.

These NEURON models (NEURON is available from http://www.neuron.yale.edu)
can be autolaunched from ModelDB to immediately start a simulation or download and extract
the archive, compile the mod files and then under

unix/linux:
-----------
type 
nrngui mosinit.hoc
at the command line

mac os X:
---------
drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon

mswin:
------
double click the mosinit.hoc file in the extracted folder

after the simulation starts:
----------------------------
First select a cell from the menu, for example FRB.
The morphologies of this model match those shown in figure 3C of the paper.

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=125857&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\FRB\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot 1&quot; /&gt;

Press the &quot;Init &amp; Run&quot; button.

When the simulation is complete you should see a figure like:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=125857&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\FRB\.\screenshot2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot2&quot; /&gt;

February 22nd, 2010: These files were updated to include data files so that
the additional FRB_12_19 and FRB_12_21 simulations can be run.

  <description>
   One of the cellular mechanisms underlying the generation of gamma oscillations is a type of cortical pyramidal neuron named fast rhythmic bursting (FRB) cells. After cells from cats' primary visual cortices were filled with Neurobiotin, the brains were cut, and the cells were photographed. One FRB cell was chosen to be confocaled, reconstructed with Neurolucida software, and generated a detailed multi-compartmental model in the NEURON program. We explore firing properties of FRB cells and the role of enhanced Na+ conductance.Reference: Lee, J (2007) Fast Rhythmic Bursting Cells: The Horizontal Fiber System in the Cat&amp;rsquo;s Primary Visual Cortex  1(1):1-

'Rejuvenation' protects neurons in mouse models of Parkinson's
disease, Nature 447, 1081-1086(28 June 2007)



This is the model demonstrated in Supplementary Information:

Figure S5: Computer simulation of the role of HCN gating in pacemaking
of DA neurons. a. NEURON simulation of autonomous spiking in an SNc DA
neuron.  Elimination of voltage-dependent Na+ channels revealed Cav1.3
L-type Ca2+ channel dependent pacemaker potentials, similar to that
found in recorded neurons. b. Elevating intracellular cAMP in the
model following the model of Siegelbaum et al. 48 produced a rightward
shift in the voltage of activation for HCN channels. This shift
increased HCN currents in a simulated voltage clamp experiment in much
the same way as seen experimentally (see Supplementary Figs. 3,
4). c. Elimination of Cav1.3 L-type Ca2+ channel silenced pacemaking
activity in the model SNc DA neuron, resembling experimental
observation.  Elevating cAMP levels and shifting HCN voltage
dependence restored pacemaking activity in the face of Cav1.3 L-type
Ca2+ channel blockade.

Sample model usage:

Start the model with auto-launch in ModelDB or download and extract
the archive and then

under mswin:
------------
1) compile the mod files with mknrndll (in the mod directory)
2) double click on the mosinit.hoc file

under linux/unix:
-----------------
1) compile the mod files with nrnivmodl (in the mod directory)
2) start with &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot; in the rejuvenation directory


Once the simulation is started:
-------------------------------
1) Click Init &amp; Run

2) Click the box to turn off Na channels to see the Cav1.3 L-type Ca2+
channel dependent pacemaker potentials

If all goes well you will create a figure similar to figure S5A in the
paper:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=97860&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\rejuvenation\.\S5a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;S5a figure&quot; /&gt;

  <description>
   Compartmental models of dendrites are the most widely used tool for investigating their electrical
behaviour. 

Traditional models assign a single potential to a compartment. 

This potential is associated with the membrane potential at the centre of the segment represented by the compartment.

All input to that segment, independent of its location on the segment, is assumed to act at the centre of the segment with the potential of the
compartment. 

By contrast, the compartmental model introduced in this article assigns a potential to each end of a
segment, and takes into account the location of input to a segment on the model solution by partitioning the effect of
this input between the axial currents at the proximal and distal boundaries of segments.

For a given neuron, the new and traditional approaches to compartmental modelling use the same number of locations at which the membrane
potential is to be determined, and lead to ordinary differential equations that are structurally identical. However, the
solution achieved by the new approach gives an order of magnitude better accuracy and precision than that achieved
by the latter in the presence of point process input.Reference: Lindsay AE, Lindsay KA, Rosenberg JR (2005) Increased Computational Accuracy in Multi-Compartmental Cable Models by a Novel Approach for Precise Point Process Localization  19:21-38

NEURON mod files from the paper:

Peter Hemond, Daniel Epstein, Angela Boley, Michele Migliore, Giorgio
A. Ascoli, and David B. Jaffe (2008) Distinct classes of pyramidal
cells exhibit mutually exclusive firing patterns in hippocampal area
CA3b.  Hippocampus 18(4):411-424

In the paper, this model was used to identify how relative differences
in K+ conductances, specifically KC, KM, &amp; KD, between cells
contribute to the different characteristics of the three types of
firing patterns observed experimentally.

The simulation ca3b-cell1zr.hoc reproduces most of the traces in Fig.9
of the paper.

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui ca3b-cell1zr.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
ca3b-cell1zr.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Under MAC OS X:

Drag and drop the ca3b folder onto the mknrndll icon in the NEURON
application folder.  When the mod files are finished compiling drag
and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

Questions on how to use this model
should be directed to michele.migliore@pa.ibf.cnr.it

After you start the simulation you can press on the figure buttons,
for example, pressing on Fig 9B leads to:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=101629&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\ca3b\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;
 
Bug and fixes:

Added the value for the I-h reversal potential (ehd_hd = -30), which
was missed from the original hoc file used to generate Fig.9. Minor
adjustements of the current injections were needed to obtain the same
patterns.  Apr-14-2008, M.Migliore

Journal of Neuroscience 28:4057-4068, 2008.

Questions about how to use this code should be addressed to 
ted.carnevale@yale.edu

na.mod and kd.mod are identical to the files used in the mitral cell
model by Shen, G.Y., Chen, W. R., Midtgaard, J., Shepherd, G.M., and
Hines, M.L.  (1999) Computational Analysis of Action Potential
Initiation in Mitral Cell Soma and Dendrites Based on Dual Patch
Recordings.  Journal of Neurophysiology 82:3006


These files will generate the data that were used to produce
Supplemental Figure 2 of Djurisic et al. (retrograde spike invasion of
the tuft with passive or active membrane).

First, be sure to compile the mod files with mknrndll or nrnivmodl.
After that, the easiest way to proceed is to use NEURON to load
mosinit.hoc
This will bring up a panel with buttons labeled &quot;Passive tuft&quot; and
&quot;Active tuft&quot;.
Clicking on one of these brings up a model with passive or active tuft
membrane, runs a simulation, and displays graphs that show:
--Peak spike amplitude throughout the tuft as a function of distance
  from the tuft origin. For example when the &quot;Passive tuft&quot; button is
  clicked on one of the graphs shows part of the data in Supplemental
  Figure 2:
&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=136026&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\djurisic2008\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;
--Normalized peak spike amplitude throughout the tuft.
--Distribution of peak spike amplitude throughtout the tuft.  In this
  graph, each compartment in the tuft is represented by a vertical
  blue line with x coordinate that is the peak spike amplitude in that
  compartment, and height that is 10 x the normalized surface area of
  that compartment (normalized by dividing compartment area by the
  total area of the tuft).
  The black curve is 10 x the smoothed probability of peak spike
  amplitude, calculated by convolving a Gaussian with Dirac delta
  functions whose x axis offsets and amplitudes are the spike peak
  amplitudes and the normalized surface areas of each compartment,
  respectively.  In other words, this is 10 x the peak spike amplitude
  probability function.
--Cumulative membrane area vs. peak spike amplitude.  This is the peak
  spike amplitude distribution function, calculated by integrating the
  Dirac delta functions (there are so many of them that no smoothing
  was necessary).
  For any point on this curve, the y coordinate is the fraction of
  tuft membrane area in which the spike peak was &lt;= the x coordinate.
  The horizontal dotted lines at y = 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 intersect this
  curve at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles.
  The x coordinates of these intersections are the peak spike
  amplitudes that correspond to these percentiles.

For the model with passive membrane there is also a small panel with
radio buttons that allow changing the values of cm and/or Rm, and
running simulations to see how these perturbations alter the results.

Running a simluation produces four output files, whose names and
contents are:

parameters.dat
Parameters of the model cell,
number of segments (compartments) in the tuft,
and the experimental condition.

areas.dat

Surface areas of all segments (compartments) in the tuft, printed tab
separated in the same order as the segments in the tuft SectionList
(see * below).  Imagine the following loop:
for each section in tuft
  for each compartment in this section, starting at its proximal end,
    print the area of this compartment

vpeak.dat
Peak depolarizations in all segments (compartments) in the tuft,
printed tab separated in the same order as the segments 
in the tuft SectionList (see * below).  Imagine the following loop:
for each section in tuft
  for each compartment in this section, starting at its proximal end,
    print the peak depolarization of this compartment

results.dat
Mean, minimum, maximum, variance and standard deviation of the peak
depolarizations in the tuft, printed tab separated.

*--This statement
forsec tuft print secname()
prints out, in sequence, the names of the sections in the tuft
SectionList.

  <description>
   The computational modeling component of Djurisic et al. 2008 addressed two primary questions: whether amplification by active currents is necessary to explain the relatively mild attenuation suffered by tuft EPSPs spreading along the primary dendrite to the soma; what accounts for the relatively uniform peak EPSP amplitude throughout the tuft. These simulations show that passive spread from tuft to soma is sufficient to yield the low attenuation of tuft EPSPs, and that random distribution of a biologically plausible number of excitatory synapses throughout the tuft can produce the experimentally observed uniformity of depolarization.

   &lt;pre&gt;October 25th, 2009: This model was updated by Michael Hines to run
under NEURON 7

 $Id: readme.txt,v 1.2 2008/10/06 16:58:43 samn Exp $ 

Table of contents:

  1. SPUD feature extraction algorithm
  2. NEURON interface to MySQL




1. SPUD

SPUD feature extraction algorithm implementation as appearing in
[1](see bottom of readme)

spud.mod - main implementation
spud.hoc - hoc utilities for ease of use
mosinit.hoc - sets up a GUI showing figure 2 from chapter - run this
  to see SPUD in action
rat_strobe_1.vec - single trace of electrocorticographic recordings
  from rat

//sample routine to demonstrate SPUD feature extraction algorithm (in
//spud.hoc) to use:
//testspud(vector,num_threshold_slices,log_spacing,[user-specified-thresholds])
//on return, output will store the extracted &quot;bumps&quot; as an NQS
//database

//$o1 = input data vector
//$2 = num threshold lines
//$3 = threshold spacing, 0=linear,1=log (optional)
//$o4 = user-specified thresholds to pass in to SPUD (optional)
proc testspud()

Once the source code is compiled (see below for instructions), run the
special file in ./arch/special , where arch is your system
architecture to start NEURON with the compiled libraries.  Then you
can use the command, load_file(&quot;mosinit.hoc&quot;), from the NEURON prompt,
which will allow generation of figure 2 from [1].

2. NEURON interface to MySQL readme - S Neymotin , WW Lytton - 4/2007

(for questions/comments contact samn at neurosim dot downstate dot
edu)

This is an interface that allows access to a MySQL server from
directly within the NEURON simulation environment [1]. It allows for
performing SQL queries and returning the results into NEURON data
structures. It also works with the Neural Query System (NQS)[2] and
can convert between NQS databases and MySQL tables.

The MySQL C API is required. The version used was mysql-5.0.37. Some
modifications were made to it in order to compile it as a NEURON
module. The main change was mysql/my_list.h had #undef LIST so it
wouldn't conflict with NEURON's list type. The C header files for the
modified version are available in this package. You'll also need to
compile the API to a lib file and link to it. The MySQL server must be
running when using this interface.


NEURON mod files: 

  MySQL.mod - main interface to MySQL
  vecst.mod - used by NQS
  misc.h,misc.mod - used by NQS

HOC files:

  mosinit.hoc - demo file
  declist.hoc - used by NQS
  decnqs.hoc - used by NQS
  decvec.hoc - used by NQS
  grvec.hoc - graphics utils.
  drline.hoc - graphics utils.
  mysql_utils.hoc - MySQL interface utilities
  nqs.hoc - NQS
  setup.hoc - setup simulation utils.


mysql directory: MySQL API header files for version 5.0.37

For help with compilation/usage, contact samn at neurosim dot
downstate dot edu .

The interface has only been tested on Linux machines with version
5.0.37 of MySQL. If you are using a different version of MySQL , this
is not guaranteed to work/compile, and you may need to make some small
changes to get it to compile.

* to build:

make sure you are in the directory containing mod files, and have the
mysql header files in a subdir named mysql (or a symbolic link will be
fine). for example, if you have the MySQL lib files in
/usr/local/src/mysql-5.0.37-linux-x86_64-glibc23/lib , you would use
the following command:

nrnivmodl -loadflags &quot;-L/usr/local/src/mysql-5.0.37-linux-x86_64-glibc23/lib -lmysqlclient -lz&quot;

if you have the MySQL lib files in a more standard location, such as
/usr/lib/mysql , you would use the following command:

nrnivmodl -loadflags &quot;-L/usr/lib/mysql/ -lmysqlclient -lz&quot;

-L should have the full path to the mysql lib files (that are already
 compiled).

-lz is for zlib

The mysql include dir must be in mod subdir (with a link is fine)

note: build can only be done once MySQL has been built on the system.


* sample usage similar to that found in mysql_test.hoc

load_file(&quot;grvec.hoc&quot;)
load_file(&quot;nqs.hoc&quot;)
load_file(&quot;mysql_utils.hoc&quot;)

Init_mysql(&quot;localhost&quot;,&quot;username&quot;,&quot;password&quot;) //connect
Query_mysql(&quot;show databases&quot;) //perform a sql query ListDBs_mysql()

see below for more example code and function descriptions

* MySQL.mod function descriptions:

all functions described below should have _mysql suffix added to them
when running from NEURON.

there is one main MYSQL object : MYSQL g_mysql;
since only one connection allowed

: closes any open connection to MySQL server
FUNCTION Close()


: initialize MySQL engine &amp; connect to MySQL server
: user must supply host-name , user-name, password
: to connect to MySQL server
: returns 1.0 iff successful
: Init(host,user,pass)
FUNCTION Init()


: SelectDB(dbname)
: returns 1.0 iff successful
FUNCTION SelectDB()


: frees results of Select, responsibility of hoc user
FUNCTION FreeResults()


: check # of columns from previous Select call
FUNCTION NumCols()


: check # of rows from previous Select call
FUNCTION NumRows()


: get rows from previous Select
: into list of vectors (each vec is dimension/column)
: returns -1.0 on error, otherwise number of rows
FUNCTION GetRows()


: takes vector and returns # of times it exists as a row in table_name
: Find(table_name,Vector) also allows partial row match on first 
: min(vector.size,table.columns) columns stores results in g_result for later
: retrieval returns -1.0 on error, otherwise num_rows found matching vector
FUNCTION Find()



: updates a single col of
: a table. 
: UpdateCol(table_name,col_name,order_by_column_name,vector_of_values,start_idx)
: col_name is the column that will be updated
: order_by_column_name is the column that stores
: ids, if no column stores ids, updating a column
: does not make much sense because the storage
: order of column values may not be what the
: user is expecting. start_idx is starting value
: of order by column index. it is incremented
: for each row of a column.
: so it will be 
: update table set col_name = vec[0] where order_by_column_name=start_idx;
: update table set col_name = vec[1] where order_by_column_name=start_idx+1;
:   ...
: update table set col_name = vec[n] where order_by_column_name=start_idx+n;
FUNCTION UpdateCol()



: inserts data into existing table
: Insert(table_name,list_of_vectors or vector)
: Vector should have same size as # of columns in table , so Insert
: will add 1 row for Vector arg if arg is List, it should have
: num_cols vectors and vectors.size rows will be inserted into table
: returns 1.0 iff success
FUNCTION Insert()


: does a sql select and keeps results around for hoc user to retrieve
: hoc user must free results at a certain point
: returns -1.0 on error, otherwise # of rows found
FUNCTION Select()
** if you do the select from NEURON with Select_mysql, it doesn't display
all the rows onto screen. after that you can do GetRows_mysql to
get the rows or NumRows_mysql to see the # of rows returned from the
select



: gets col names from last sql select must pass in correct # of
: char* 's and they must have sufficient length to store col names
FUNCTION GetColNames()


: lists all available dbs
: returns -1 iff error, otherwise # of dbs
FUNCTION ListDBs()


: executes a sql command but doesnt store results for hoc user
: can execute any type of SQL command, i.e. create,select,insert,etc.
: displays results on screen
: returns -1.0 on error
: Query(query_string)
FUNCTION Query()


: display client &amp; server versions
PROCEDURE VersionInfo()


* sample hoc code


the following proc works only if there is
a pre-existing database named &quot;test&quot;
to create it do: Query_mysql(&quot;create database test&quot;)

objref lv,myv[2],lvres
proc TestInsert(){
  Init_mysql(&quot;your_host&quot;,&quot;your_user_name&quot;,&quot;your_password&quot;)
  SelectDB_mysql(&quot;test&quot;)
  Query_mysql(&quot;create table junk (d1 double,d2 double)&quot;)
  lv=new List()
  myv[0]=new Vector(10)
  myv[0].indgen(0,10)
  myv[1]=new Vector(10)
  myv[1].indgen(10,20)
  lv.append(myv[0])
  lv.append(myv[1])
  Insert_mysql(&quot;junk&quot;,lv)
  Query_mysql(&quot;select * from junk&quot;)
}
TestInsert()


Insert can take a Vector or List of Vectors

objref myv
proc TestInsert2(){
  Init_mysql(&quot;your_host&quot;,&quot;your_user_name&quot;,&quot;your_password&quot;)
  Query_mysql(&quot;use test&quot;)
  Query_mysql(&quot;create table jnk (d1 double,d2 double)&quot;)
  myv=new Vector(2)
  myv.x(0)=0
  myv.x(1)=1
  Insert_mysql(&quot;jnk&quot;,myv)
  Query_mysql(&quot;select * from jnk&quot;)
}

there are some hoc utility functions in mysql_utils.hoc (don't add _mysql to call them):

//creates a table in db currently connected to
//$s1 = table name
//$o2 = list of column names (as String objects or strdefs)
//$3 = whether to create index for each col
func CreateTable () 

// SelectedColNames()
// returns List containing column names from last Select call
obfunc SelectedColNames()

//converts the results of a sql select
//into an nqs db &amp; returns it
//$s1 = sql query
obfunc sql2nqs ()

//converts nqs database to sql format automatically creates indices
//$o1 = nqs
//$s2 = name of table in mysql db
//$3 = whether to create column nqs_row_id storing orig nqs row index
//$4 = whether to create mysql index on each col
// NB: table must not have 'index' as a col name: mysql reserved word
func nqs2sql () 


example usage:

objref ls
objref cols[5]
proc TestCreateTable(){ local ii,makeindex
  ls=new List()
  for ii=0,4{
    cols[ii]=new String()
    sprint(cols[ii].s,&quot;col%d&quot;,ii+1)
    ls.append(cols[ii])
  }
  makeindex = 1
  if(CreateTable(&quot;hoc_table&quot;,ls,makeindex)){
    Query_mysql(&quot;show tables&quot;)
    Query_mysql(&quot;describe hoc_table&quot;)
  } else {
    Query_mysql(&quot;show tables&quot;)
  }
}
TestCreateTable()

this will create a table named &quot;hoc_table&quot; in current database with
indices on each column

These files were contributed by Stephanie Jones.
Here is a description of the files:

File: sj10-cortex.hoc
Creates cells and network (grid of layer 5 and layer 2/3 cells - 100
pyramidal neurons and 35 interneurons in each layer).

Contains templates for multi-compartment Layer 5 and Layer 2/3
pyramidal neurons and single compartment inhibitory neurons, and all
synaptic conductances in the SI cortical column model.

Creates a template &quot;FeedX&quot; that is used to externally drive the
network when simulating an &quot;evoked response&quot; (specified in Batch.hoc
and scale_ep_thresh.hoc) and/or an &quot;ongoing mu rhythm&quot; (specified in
MuBurst_10.hoc and E_FFFBx_fixed_10.hoc).

Creates a 2-D grid of cells with all possible connections such that
the inhibitory neurons are placed every 2 pyramidal neurons with
procedure I_zig_zag.

Creates a &quot;dipole current&quot; for each cell (defined in dipole.hoc) and
each layer.

File: wiring_proc_2Dv2.hoc
Procedures for simulating synaptic connections across the local SI
cortical column model.  These are set up with a Gaussian decay profile
for weight and delay from a center of mass in the network. The maximum
weights, min delays, synapse type, and post-synaptic targeted
dendritic compartment numbers are defined in wiring-SmlFeed-3_7.hoc.

File: wiring-SmlFeed-3_7.hoc
Defines the fixed connections within the SI network by specifying
weights, delays, synapse type, and post-synaptic dendritic target
compartments numbers.

File noise2D_v2.hoc
Procedures for simulating ongoing background noise to the network.
The weights are defined in Batch.hoc.

File:  MuBurst_10.hoc
Procedure (make_MuBursts) creates &quot;feedforward (FF)&quot; and
&quot;feedback(FB)&quot; external driving input to the SI cortical column model
(as FeedX objects) simulating an ongoing &quot;mu&quot; rhythms such that the SI
network is driven ever 100ms for (starting at 150ms â&amp;euro;&amp;ldquo; to allow the
network to reach a steady state â&amp;euro;&amp;ldquo; until 1450) by 10 spiking neurons
(totaling 150 spike driving neurons over a 1500ms simulation, see Fig
2 in Jones et al. 2009). The weight of these inputs and the delay
between FF and FB drive are set in E-FFFBx_10.hoc

File: E_FFFBx_fixed_10.hoc 
Procedure (e_fffbx) defines the weight and delay between the ongoing
FF and FB input to the SI network, with a different weight during the
period in which an evoked response is simulated (550-850ms).

File: scale_ep_thresh.hoc
Defines the properties of the simulated &quot;evoked response&quot; input by
specifying weights, delays, synapse type, and post-synaptic dendritic
target compartments numbers.

File dipole.hoc
Creates a template that defines the &quot;dipole current&quot; for each
cells. The dipole current is the measure of a magnetoencepholography
(MEG) signal.
 
File: batch.hoc 
Calls in all the necessary files, sets default parameters, initial
conditions, and runs the simulations creating 26 runs of a 1500ms
simulation of an ongoing mu rhythm with a simulated evoked response
starting at 450ms.

Folder: STATES
Contains data files for all of the initial conditions. 

Folder: mod_files
The .mod files.  In addition the default hh mechanism is used.

Usage instructions:
This version of the model was parallelized by Michael Hines.  Please
check your NEURON version (the message that neuron outputs when
started).  For example, running nrniv might display NEURON -- VERSION
7.2 (499:91db257165c4) 2011-01-25.  The number before the colon needs
to be greater than or equal to 499 as above.

After unzipping the attached file (on the parallel cluster master) and
cd'ing to the created folder compile the mod files with the command

nrnivmodl mod_files

and then type

mpirun -n 4 nrniv -mpi Batch.hoc

replacing the 4 above with a number of processors that you have
available.

  <description>
   &quot;Variations in cortical oscillations in the alpha (7&amp;ndash;14 Hz) and beta (15&amp;ndash;29 Hz) range have been correlated with attention, working memory, and stimulus detection. The mu rhythm recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a prominent oscillation generated by Rolandic cortex containing alpha and beta bands. Despite its prominence, the neural mechanisms regulating mu are unknown. We characterized the ongoing MEG mu rhythm from a localized source in the finger representation of primary somatosensory (SI) cortex. Subjects showed variation in the relative expression of mu-alpha or mu-beta, which were nonoverlapping for roughly 50% of their respective durations on single trials. To delineate the origins of this rhythm, a biophysically principled computational neural model of SI was developed, with distinct laminae, inhibitory and excitatory neurons, and feedforward (FF, representative of lemniscal thalamic drive) and feedback (FB, representative of higher-order cortical drive or input from nonlemniscal thalamic nuclei) inputs defined by the laminar location of their postsynaptic effects. ...&quot;Reference: Jones SR, Pritchett DL, Sikora MA, Stufflebeam SM, Hamalainen M, Moore CI (2009) Quantitative Analysis and Biophysically Realistic Neural Modeling of the MEG Mu Rhythm: Rhythmogenesis and Modulation of Sensory-Evoked Responses.  102:3554-72

   The paper demonstrate a form of graded persistent activity activated by hyperpolarization.  This phenomenon is modeled based on a slow calcium regulation of Ih, similar to that introduced
earlier for thalamic neurons (see Destexhe et al., J Neurophysiol. 1996). The only difference is that the calcium signal is here provided by the high-threshold calcium current (instead of the low-threshold calcium current in thalamic neurons).Reference: Winograd M, Destexhe A, Sanchez-Vives MV (2008) Hyperpolarization-activated graded persistent activity in the prefrontal cortex.  105:7298-303

Receptor-Mediated Modulation of Voltage-Dependent Na+ Channels Reduces
Autonomous Activity in Striatal Cholinergic Interneurons, J
Neurosci. 2004 Nov 17;24(46):10289-301.

This is the model demonstrated in Figure 10.G:

Figure 10. Modest reduction of Na+ channel currents mimics D2 receptor
effects on pacemaking...G, In a simulation of pacemaking (Na+ channel
density of 1.4 mS/cm2), mimicking the D2 receptor modulation by
selectively increasing Na+ channel entry into a slow-inactivated state
(as in D, E) slowed the discharge rate by &amp;gt;40%. Restoration of the
control values for this rate constant restored the discharge rate.

Sample model usage:

To mimic the modulation of the D2 receptor, use the &quot;Set Value 1&quot; and
&quot;Set Value 2&quot; buttons in the Change Variable Value panel.  This should
show the decrease in discharge rate seen in Figure 10.G.

   &quot;... Using a combination of electrophysiological, molecular, and computational approaches, the studies reported here show that D2 dopamine receptor modulation of Na+ currents underlying autonomous spiking contributes to a slowing of discharge rate, such as that seen in vivo. Four lines of evidence support this conclusion. ... Fourth, simulation of cholinergic interneuron pacemaking revealed that a modest increase in the entry of Na+ channels into the slow-inactivated state was sufficient to account for the slowing of pacemaker discharge. These studies establish a cellular mechanism linking dopamine and the reduction in striatal cholinergic interneuron activity seen in the initial stages of associative learning.&quot; See paper for more and details.Reference: Maurice N, Mercer J, Chan CS, Hernandez-Lopez S, Held J, Tkatch T, Surmeier DJ (2004) D2 dopamine receptor-mediated modulation of voltage-dependent Na+ channels reduces autonomous activity in striatal cholinergic interneurons.  24:10289-301

   &lt;pre&gt;This directory includes a demonstration of the fitness function 
and optimization method described in

    Weaver, CM and Wearne, SL.  The role of action potential shape
    and parameter constraints in optimization of compartment models.
    Neurocomputing 69: 1053-1057, (2006).



I.  To run this demo:

Either Auto-launch from ModelDB or 
--------------
1) download and extract the archive.
2) Then under

unix/linux: type the following at the command line:

	cd weaver_SimAnn_ObjFcn
	nrnivmodl model optmz
	nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin: start nrngui (from the start button -&amp;gt;Programs -&amp;gt; NEURON 5.9
       for example) then File -&amp;gt; working dir to first the model
       directory and then File -&amp;gt; working dir to the optmz directory.
       Then you can File -&amp;gt; load hoc and select mosinit.hoc.

mac OS X: running under mac is under development
--------------

Once the model is running you can press the &quot;Testing Shapes&quot; windows
buttons (e.g. &quot;Matched to Target&quot;, etc.) to select alternate initial
conditions.

A.  Different Objective Functions

This demo evaluates the difference betweeen model and target data by
two different functions, specified under the Multiple Run Fitter
Generators:

(1) RegionFitness, i.e. mean squared error between voltage traces
(2) APShpFRCVFitness: a linear combination of the errors in
    time-aligned AP shape, mean FR, and irregularity measured by the
    CV.  (See Weaver and Wearne reference above).  The weights of each
    component can be changed by displaying the APShpFRCVFitness
    generator, then choosing Select, followed by the appropriate
    drop-down menu choice.

Click on one of the buttons to the left.  This will initialize the
model, run it, and evaluate the error between that model and the
target data shown in the MRF windows.

Summary data are written to matlab files (.m extension) that print the
model and target voltage traces, plus a summary of the AP Shape / FR /
CV error.  The name of this output file can be changed by bringing up
the appropriate MRF Generator and choosing Select -&amp;gt; Set output info.

B.  Simulated annealing for parameter optimization

   If you go to the MRF window and choose Parameters -&amp;gt; Select
   Optimizer, there are two new options:

    - Simulated Annealing
    - Constrained Simulated Annealing with Recentering

    The first, implemented by Andrew Davison, performs the
    Simplex-based simulated annealing optimization algorithm found in
    Numerical Recipes in C.

    The second, implemented by Christina Weaver, performs a version of
    this algorithm that incorporates constraints on the parameters to
    be optimized.  See Weaver and Wearne (2006) for details, and for
    the original reference (Cardoso et al. 1996) which introduced this
    algorithm.  See the enclosed PDF help file for details of this
    NEURON implementation.


    In addition to a new set of Optimizer menu items specific to these
    optimization techniques, one change has been made to the general
    MRF Optimize menu.  In the past the output from a parameter search
    was always output to the same filename, so that one would often
    run the risk of overwriting previous searches.  The name of the
    output file can be changed by clicking on &quot;Change output filename&quot;
    and entering a new string, e.g. &quot;filename&quot;.  Data will be written
    to &quot;filename&quot;.tmp during the search, and &quot;filename&quot;.fit once the
    search has finished.

meantime!

   &quot;... We construct an
objective function that includes both time-aligned action potential shape error and errors in firing rate and firing regularity. We then
implement a variant of simulated annealing that introduces a recentering algorithm to handle infeasible points outside the boundary
constraints. We show how our objective function captures essential features of neuronal firing patterns, and why our boundary
management technique is superior to previous approaches.&quot;Reference: Weaver CM, Wearne SL (2006) The role of action potential shape and parameter constraints in optimization of compartment models  69:1053-1057

These files were supplied by Bill Lytton.

These NEURON files only run on the linux/nix platforms.

This simulation is primarily an illustration and is not well optimized
for actually running large networks.

jitcon.mod contains a large amount of C level code, understanding of
which requires some knowledge of Neuron internals

To run either auto-launch from modeldb or download and extract the
archive. In the extracted directory type

nrnivmodl
nrngui mosinit.hoc

Once the simulation is running. Click the click here to run button.
About a minute later a graph like this will hopefully appear

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=106891&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\b07dec27_20091025\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

The simulator also launches a GUI panel that can be double clicked to
look at cell traces

See headers of jitcon.mod and bstick_net.hoc for extensive (though
alas not complete) commentary.

Migliore (2011) A Multi-Compartment Model for Interneurons in the
Dorsal Lateral Geniculate Nucleus.  PLoS Comp. Biol. 7: e1002160


The model was adapted to experimental Current-Clamp data from two
interneurons in the dLGN (IN1 and IN2). Two respective
parameterizations were obtained (P1 &amp; P2).
Each parameterization qualitatively reproduces the response pattern of
the respective neuron under 8 different experimental
conditions. Furthermore, quantitative data on #APs elicited as a
function of injected current was reproduced.

These model files were supplied by Geir Halnes.

Use: These files require the NEURON simulator available from
www.neuron.yale.edu.  After installing NEURON either auto-launch (may
require configuring your browser) or download and extract this archive
and compile the mod files (mswin: run mknrndll, mac: drag and drop the
archive folder onto mknrndll, linux/unix: type &quot;nrnivmodl&quot; in a shell
in the archive folder).  Start the simulation (mswin: double click the
mosinit.hoc file, mac: drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto nrngui,
linux/unix: type &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot; in the archive folder).  Once
the simulation starts click the buttons with the following options:


P1: MP = -63
Opens the model with Parameterization 1.
Model for interneuron with resting potential at -63mV.
The user can change the amplitude of the injected current
(-150pA, -25pA, 20pA, 55pA, 60pA, 65pA, 70pA used in paper)
The 55pA default setting reproduces the fourth trace in figure 4 A1
(when Init &amp; Run is clicked):

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=140249&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\dLGN_modelDB\.\screenshot1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot1&quot; /&gt;

P1: HP = -57
Opens the model with Parameterization 1.
Uses a continous weak current injection (22pA) to obtain a holding
potential of -57mV. Strong hyperpolarizing current injection (-150pA)
is then followed by a rebound burst.
Here Init &amp; Run click will produce figure 4 B1:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=140249&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\dLGN_modelDB\.\screenshot2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot2&quot; /&gt;

P2: MP = -69
Opens the model with Parameterization 2.
Model for interneuron with resting potential at -69mV.
The user can change the amplitude of the injected current
(-150pA, -25pA, 20pA, 40pA, 50pA, 60pA, 70pA used in paper)
Here the setting of 40pA will reproduce the 4th trace in Fig 4 A2:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=140249&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\dLGN_modelDB\.\screenshot3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot3&quot; /&gt;

P2: HP = -58
Opens the model with Parameterization 
Uses a continous weak current injection (12pA) to obtain a holding
potential of -58mV.
Strong hyperpolarizing current injection (-150pA) is followed by a
subthreshold rebound response, figure 4 B2:

contributions to vestibular signal processing: impact of ion

Abstract:

Head motion-related sensory signals are transformed by second-order
vestibular neurons (2°VNs) into appropriate commands for retinal image
stabilization during body motion. In frogs, these 2°VNs form two
distinct subpopulations that have either tonic or highly phasic
intrinsic properties, essentially compatible with low-pass and
bandpass filter characteristics, respectively. In the present study,
physiological data on cellular properties of 2°VNs of the grass frog
(Rana temporaria) have been used to construct conductance-based
spiking cellular models that were fine-tuned by fitting to recorded
spike-frequency data. The results of this approach suggest that
low-threshold, voltage-dependent potassium channels in phasic and
spike-dependent potassium channels in tonic 2°VNs are important
contributors to the differential, yet complementary response
characteristics of the two vestibular subtypes. Extension of the
cellular model with conductance-based synapses allowed simulation of
afferent excitation and evaluation of the emerging properties of local
feedforward inhibitory circuits. This approach revealed the relative
contributions of intrinsic and synaptic factors on afferent signal
processing in phasic 2°VNs. Additional extension of the single-cell
model to a population model allowed testing under more natural
conditions including asynchronous afferent labyrinthine input and
synaptic noise. This latter approach indicated that the feedforward
inhibition from the local inhibitory network acts as a high-pass
filter, which reinforces the impact of the intrinsic membrane
properties of phasic 2°VNs on peak response amplitude and
timing. Thus, the combination of cellular and network properties
enables phasic 2°VNs to work as a noise-resistant detector, suitable
for central processing of short-duration vestibular signals.

Komendantov AO, Komendantova OG, Johnson SW, Canavier CC (2004) A
modeling study suggests complementary roles for GABAA and NMDA
receptors and the SK channel in regulating the firing pattern in
midbrain dopamine neurons. J Neurophysiol 91:346-57

Midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons in vivo exhibit two major firing
patterns: single-spike firing and burst firing. The firing pattern
expressed is dependent on both the intrinsic properties of the neurons
and their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Experimental data
suggest that the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and GABAA
receptors is a crucial contributor to the initiation and suppression
of burst firing, respectively, and that blocking Ca(2+)-activated
potassium SK channels can facilitate burst firing. A
multi-compartmental model of a DA neuron with a branching structure
was developed and calibrated based on in vitro experimental data to
explore the effects of different levels of activation of NMDA and
GABAA receptors as well as the modulation of the SK current on the
firing activity. The simulated tonic activation of GABAA receptors was
calibrated by taking into account the difference in the electrotonic
properties in vivo versus in vitro. Although NMDA-evoked currents are
required for burst generation in the model, currents evoked by
GABAA-receptor activation can also regulate the firing pattern. For
example, the model predicts that increasing the level of NMDA receptor
activation can produce excessive depolarization that prevents burst
firing, but a concurrent increase in the activation of GABAA receptors
can restore burst firing. Another prediction of the model is that
blocking the SK channel current in vivo will facilitate bursting, but
not as robustly as blocking the GABAA receptors.

These model files were supplied by Anna Kuznetsova

Usage:
Auto-launch from ModelDB to for a graphical interface to the model.

If you have installed NEURON with mpi on x86_64 systems you can double
check that
/usr/local/neuron/x86_64/bin is in your path
To compile the code (under unix) type:

nrnivmodl

In order to run the code:
if you want a graphical user interface set back = 0 in damodel.hoc
then type:

x86_64/special damodel.hoc -

and hit the init and run button

to run simulations in the background set back = 1
mpirun -nolocal x86_64/special damodel.hoc&amp;gt;&amp; myfile.dat&amp;
(This prints soma and dendrite voltages and some currents to myfile.dat)

Run in the background generates state.new file. To restart from these last data
copy state.new over state.old and set restart = 1 in damodel.hoc. (This works
both for GUI and background).

This package is running with the NEURON simulation program written by Michael
Hines and available on internet at:
  http://www.neuro.duke.edu/neuron/home.html

The package contains mechanisms (.mod files) and programs (.oc files) needed 
to simulate interconnected thalamocortical (TRN) relative to the paper:
Wang, J., Chen, S., Nolan, M. F. and Siegelbaum, S. A. (2002)  Activity-
Dependent Regulation of HCN Pacemaker Channels by Cyclic AMP: Signaling 
through Dynamic Allosteric Coupling.  Neuron 36(3), 451-462.

  PROGRAMS
  ========

TCIClamp.hoc

Demonstration of the physiological consequences of the cyclic
allosteric gating scheme for Ih mediated by HCN2 in 
thalamocortical relay cells.  This simulation will reproduce
the current-clamp experiment to examine sag and rebound 
responses to a current step and depolarizing responses to a 
cAMP pulse described in figure 7 of Wang et al. 2002.  The
thalamocortical cell properties are modified from Destexhe et
al 1996, with Ih removed and replaced with a kinetic model of 
HCN2 and the T-type Ca2+ current also removed to focus on the 
role of the H-current.

see Fig. 7 of Wang et al, 2002
 

  MECHANISMS
  ==========

HH2.mod				: fast sodium spikes (Na and K currents)
kleak.mod		 		: leak K+ current 
cAMPclamp.mod		: clamp intracellular cAMP concentration.
hcn2.mod		: HCN2 channel gating from Wang et al 2002.
TCmod.tem	: Template file for a single compartment model of a thalamocortical
                : neuron modified from the model described by Destexhe et al, 1995.
						  
						  
  HOW TO RUN
  ==========
Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui TCIClamp2.hoc

Under Windows using NEURON 5.2:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
TCIClamp2.hoc will open the simulation window.

Once the menu and graphics interface has appeared, choose the concentration of
cAMP inside the cell first, otherwise 0 cAMP will be chosen. Then click the
currentstep button to see the simulation of the membrane potential changes of 
the cell in the presense of the specified concentration of cAMP or click the cAMP 
pulse button to see the simulation of the fluctuation of the membrane potential if 
a pulse of specified concentration of cAMP is given to the cell...

   &lt;pre&gt;Example simulation produces a few curves from fig 4b.
Discrepancies may be due to differences between the
synapse file used by the figure and the synapse locations
defined in Files/meyLongSynfile3.hoc

mosinit.hoc and mosinit.ses file were created by Michael Hines.
In order to run the example, the last few lines of
sim_hoc_files/sim_ampa.hoc were commented out to avoid generating
a large number of results files. Also the mod files were moved out of
a Mod subdirectory and into the top directory to conform to the
policy of the mos2nrn autolaunch program.

   &lt;pre&gt;SIMULATION OF PNS MYELINATED AXON

This model is described in detail in:

McIntyre CC, Richardson AG, and Grill WM. Modeling the excitability of
mammalian nerve fibers: influence of afterpotentials on the recovery
cycle. Journal of Neurophysiology 87:995-1006, 2002.

The model is set up to reproduce part of Fig 2A from this paper.

This model can not be used with NEURON v5.1 as errors in the
extracellular mechanism of v5.1 exist related to xc. The original
stimulations were run on v4.3.1. NEURON v5.2 has corrected the
limitations in v5.1 and can be used to run this model.

Please contact mcintyre@bme.jhu.edu if you have any questions about
the model

20110523 rare condition bug fix supplied by Ted Carnevale where
vtrap2, 7, and 8 assignments in AXNODE.mod were fixed to prevent
discontinuity.

   &lt;pre&gt;Neural_Computation
------------------

Simmulations that illustrate the application of simple kinetic models
for excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents.  These simulations
are related to the following paper:

   Destexhe, A., Mainen, Z.F. and Sejnowski, T.J.  An efficient method for
   computing synaptic conductances based on a kinetic model of receptor binding
   Neural Computation 6: 10-14, 1994.  

   (see postscript file synapse.ps.Z)

   ( or pdf at http://cns.iaf.cnrs-gif.fr/abstracts/synapse.html )

This directory contains all the files needed to run the simulations
using the Interviews version of NEURON.  These files are commented and
should run straighforwardly, provided the NEURON simulator is
installed properly.



The kinetic synapse mechanism
-----------------------------

This mechanisms has the following properties:

1. It is based on a simple kinetic scheme of binding of transmitter on
   postsynaptic receptors.  This description has the advantage that
   it is fully compatible with the level of description used for other
   mechanisms (Hodgkin-Huxley currents, calcium diffusion, etc).

2. The mechanism gives EPSP's or IPSP's from a pulse of transmitter.
   The waveform of these PSP's is very close to EPSP's or IPSP's measured 
   experimentally, and the decay is monoexponential.  The user can set all
   the parameters corresponding to the rising phase, decay, amplitude, etc...
   (see .mod files)

3. Summation of consecutive PSP's is handled automatically by the 
   mechanism without need for an explicit event cue.  

4. Each synapse has a state variable corresponding to the fraction of 
   postsynaptic receptors in the open state.  However, the kinetics are
   first order, and so can be solved exactly.  This has the important
   advantage that it can be fit very easily to experimental recordings
   (see J. Computational Neurosci. paper).

5. Finally, this mechanism is very fast to compute. It does not require 
   solving any differential equations; at any given time only one exponential
   is calculated per synapse.  Thus, the mechanism is as fast to compute as 
   optimized versions of alpha function-based models.



How to run the simulation
-------------------------

This directory contains the files necessary to run a simulation such as
illustrated in Fig.1 of the Neural Computation paper.

To compile the demo, NEURON and INTERVIEWS must be installed and working on
the machine you are using.  Just type &quot;nrnivmodl&quot; to compile the mechanisms
given in the mod files (glutamate.mod and gaba.mod are the mechanisms
for glutamate and gaba synapses, and HH.mod is the Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics). 

Then, execute one of the two example files by typing:

special demo_glutamate_neuralcomputation.oc -

or

special demo_gaba_neuralcomputation.oc - 

Once the menu and graphics interface has appeared, click on &quot;Init and Run&quot;
button to start the simulation...






All these simulations were done using the NEURON simulator written by
Michael Hines, and which is available freely on internet via anonymous
ftp from neuron.neuro.duke.edu:/neuron.  For more information about how
to get NEURON and how to install it, please refer to the following sites:

  <description>
   A simple model of transmitter release is used to solve first order kinetic equations of neurotransmiter/receptor binding.  This method is applied to a glutamate and gabaa receptor.  See reference for more details. The method is extended to more complex kinetic schemes in a seperate paper (Destexhe et al J Comp Neuro 1:195-231, 1994).  Application to AMPA, NMDA, GABAA, and GABAB receptors is given in a book chapter (Destexhe et al In: The Neurobiology of Computation, Edited by Bower, J., Kluwer Academic Press, Norwell MA, 1995, pp. 9-14.)

These files were contributed by Masaki Nomura.

Example use: auto-launch from ModelDB (after NEURON is installed) or
download the archive and run with appropriate OS command:

(linux) type the command &quot;nrngui run.hoc&quot; at the shell prompt after
cd'ing to the folder created when the archive was expanded.
(mswin) double click the run.hoc file in windows explorer.
(mac) drag and drop the folder created when the archive was expanded
onto the nrngui icon.

Once the simulation is started you can select a cell type, for
example, click the Martinotti cell, BE17BNoActive, and then click the
RunControl, and PointManager buttons.  In the PointManager click
SelectPointProcess -&gt; AlphaSynapse PointProcess and set onset=10ms,
tau=1ms, gmax=0.002. From the NEURON Main Menu select Graph -&gt; Voltage
axis. Press Init &amp; Run button on the RunControl window and you should
see a graph like a trace in Figure 6a left panel:

   &quot; ... Using electron microscopy and serial reconstructions, we analyzed the dendritic trees of
four morphologically distinct neocortical interneuron subtypes to reveal two underlying organizational
principles common to all.

First, cross-sectional areas at any given point within a dendrite were proportional
to the summed length of all dendritic segments distal to that point.

...
Second, dendritic cross-sections
became progressively more elliptical at more proximal, larger diameter, dendritic locations.

Finally,
computer simulations revealed that these conserved morphological features limit distance dependent
filtering of somatic EPSPs and facilitate distribution of somatic depolarization into all dendritic
compartments.

7/11/2005 Changes added which removes electrode on subsequent simulations.
Note: 3/9/2002 Michael Hines made non-substantive changes to allow the
3 demos to run in the same NEURON process. Thus the original button panel
was replaced by a radio button panel, and any files which should only
be opened once per NEURON launch are now opened via load_file instead
of xopen. Lastly, before the gui for each demo is started the previous
gui is erased with the restart() procedure which was added to
rundemo.hoc

This is the readme for the model for the paper

Palmer LM, Stuart GJ (2009) Membrane potential changes in dendritic
spines during action potentials and synaptic input. J Neurosci 29:6897-903

The authors supplied the cell and spine morphologies and code to
create Fig 5B. The ModelDB administrator added scripts to recreate
additional figures from the paper.

To run the simulation: Auto-launch from modeldb or download and
extract the archive and then under

unix/linux
----------
cd to the newly extracted folder and type nrnivmodl to compile the mod
file then type nrngui mosinit.hoc to start the simulation.

mswin
-----
run mknrndll and traverse to the newly extracted folder to make the
dll.  Double click on the mosinit.hoc file in windows explorer

Mac OS X
--------
Drag and drop the folder onto the mknrndll icon to compile the mod
file and then drag the &quot;run&quot; hoc file onto the NEURON icon.

Once the simulation has started you can select from the buttons which
simulation you would like to run:
If you click on the Fig 5B button you should see:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=120798&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\PalmerStuart2009\.\fig5b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fig. 5b&quot; /&gt;

Clicking the &quot;Fig 5C, D&quot; button, after a few seconds, will display:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=120798&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\PalmerStuart2009\.\fig5cd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fig. 5cd&quot; /&gt;

The supplementary figure 2c button, &quot;Suppl. Fig. 2c&quot;, will run to
completion in a few seconds generating:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=120798&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\PalmerStuart2009\.\suplfig2c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Suppl. Fig. 2c&quot; /&gt;

Finally, we used simulations of our experimental observations in
morphologically realistic models to estimate spine neck resistance.

These simulations indicated that spine neck resistance ranges up
to ~500 M Ohm.

Spine neck resistances of this magnitude reduce somatic EPSPs by ~15%,
indicating that the spine neck is unlikely to act as a physical device
to significantly modify synaptic strength.&quot;Reference: Palmer LM, Stuart GJ (2009) Membrane potential changes in dendritic spines during action potentials and synaptic input.  29:6897-903

	Dynamical mechanisms of odor processing in olfactory bulb 
	mitral cells.

This model mitral cell (the principal output neuron of the vertebrate 
olfactory bulb) comprises four compartments (soma, apical dendrite, 
apical tuft, lateral dendrite) and exhibits endogenous subthreshold 
oscillations, phase resetting, and evoked spike phasing properties 
as described in mitral cells by:

Run the model using the file mosinit.hoc after compiling the .mod files.

An xpanel will appear enabling easy recreation of many figures from the 
2006 paper.  Be patient on slower machines as traces will by default only 
become visible after 1600-2000 ms computed time.  Parameters can be derived 
from the xpanel code or from the tables in the 2006 paper.

M. Migliore, Modeling the attenuation and failure of action potentials in 
the dendrites of hippocampal neurons, Biophys. J. 71:2394-403 (1996).
 
The paper proposed (and experiments later confirmed) a slow inactivation 
of the Na channels as the mechanism responsible for the progressive 
reduction of action potentials amplitude, observed in the dendrites of 
CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons during a train.  This mechanism was 
modeled using an additional gate variable in the Na+ conductance. The 
gate variable and its kinetics are now included in the updated Na+ 
conductance (na3.mod) of the 1999 CA1 model.


Under unix systems:
===================
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui figs.hoc

Under Windows:
==============
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll DOS box&quot; and 
follow on-screen instructions.
A double click on the simulation file
figs.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

This CA1 model can be used to run three related simulations, 
corresponding to the simulations shown in Fig.3 (right), Fig.4bc, 
and Fig.4bd of the paper.

&quot;run Fig.3&quot; will show somatic and dendritic membrane potential during
a 450ms suprathreshold dendritic current injection on a distal
compartment, followed by a 70ms current pulse after a 250ms delay.

To demonstrate the recovery from slow inactivation, &quot;run Fig.4bc&quot; will 
show membrane potential of a distal compartment from 4 overlapping 
simulations with the same initial 450ms dendritic current injection 
followed by a short 70 pulse after different delays.

To demonstrate that hyperpolarization increases the rate of recovery
as observed in the experiments,&quot;run Fig.4bd&quot; will show the same simulation
as in &quot;run Fig.3&quot;, but with a -0.5nA dendritic current injection during 
the 250ms delay.

Geometry-induced features of current transfer in neuronal dendrites 
with tonically activated conductances.

Running the mosinit.hoc program recreates all the figures of the 
paper. To compute and display a figure click on the corresponding 
item (e.g. &quot;Fig.1.&quot; then &quot;Fig.1. A, C&quot; or &quot;Fig.5.&quot; then &quot;Fig.5. E-G&quot; 
then &quot;Asymmetric&quot;) of the &quot;Article Results&quot; menu window, operating 
similar to &quot;NEURON Main Menu&quot;. This presentation was programmed by 
Valery I. Kukushka.

The models illustrate the biophysical basis for a universal estimate 
of effectiveness of the current transfer from distributed (multiple) 
tonic excitatory synaptic input along the dendritic paths with passive 
or active membrane properties. Introducing uniform steady synaptic 
conductivity in the dendritic membrane simulates such input. The figures 
show how the membrane properties and typical morphological 
heterogeneities  (change in diameter, branching) of dendrites determine 
the geometry-dependent pattern of the effectiveness, i.e. the 
contribution from various dendritic sites to the total current reaching 
the soma, during tonic excitation. For that the NEURON programs compute
and display the path profiles of the membrane voltage, total and partial
conductivities, total current per unit membrane area and the core
current increment per unit path length. The latter is the effectiveness 
estimate. Noteworthy are path profiles of the effective equilibrium 
potential of the total membrane current. It is the deviation of the 
membrane potential from the effective equilibrium level that determines 
the driving potential of the membrane current. Tonic dendritic 
depolarization was always the greatest on the distal tips and decayed 
toward the soma with unequal rates along asymmetrical paths (more 
depolarized were longer sister paths). Because of positive slope of the 
local steady current-voltage relation (linear, passive or non-linear, 
active) of the dendritic membrane in the whole range of voltages more 
depolarized dendritic sites made smaller contribution to the somatopetal 
core current.

Membrane mechanisms:

PasD.mod  - passive extrasynaptic and synaptic currents (models with 
passive dendrites)
PasS.mod  - passive synaptic current (models with active dendrites)
Hh1.mod  - sodium, potassium and leak currents of Hodgkin-Huxley type 
(models with active dendrites)
PasSA.mod: passive membrane current of the soma and axon (all models)

Passive axon was excluded from the models with branching dendrites (not 
indicated in the paper).

clamping neurons expressing voltage-gated conductances. J Neurophysiol

You can auto-launch from ModelDB (after you have installed NEURON) and
then choose Potassium or Calcium conductance simulations to generate
figures associated with Figures 1 and 4. You can further create graphs
of sample spatial voltage values by selecting from the NEURON Main
Menu &quot;Graph&quot; -&gt; &quot;Shape Plot&quot; and then drag the mouse from the box in
the upper left corner of the graph to select &quot;Space plot&quot; from the
pop-up menu.  Finally, drag the mouse from the lower extremity of the
cell to the top.  When you release the mouse button a graph of the
voltage along the path you selected through the cell appears (see
bottom of below figure which was created after Potassium and then the
L5 Pyramidal Neuron were selected and then after the run (takes about
20 seconds) the above shape plot procedure was followed):

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=110560&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\SpaceClampDemo\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

Alternatively you can run the files manually.  The demo code contains
two simulations.  The &quot;potassium.hoc&quot; file contains code simulating
parts of figure 1.  The &quot;calcium.hoc&quot; file contains code simulating
parts of figure 4.  To run the simulations you will have to first
compile the MOD files in the SpaceClampDemo directory (nrnivmodl under
Linux, mknrndll under windows, or drag and drop the SpaceClampDemo
folder onto the mknrndll icon under MAC OS X).  To run the simulations
simply run one of the above HOC files, or the mosinit.hoc file.  In
windows just double click on the icon, in Linux invoke the &quot;nrngui
filename -&quot; command, and under the MAC drag and drop the mosinit.hoc
file onto the nrngui icon.

All simulations will generate two graphs, one displaying the membrane
potential in pseudo color in each compartment of the neuron and one
displaying the activation of the voltage-gated conductance also in
pseudo color.

   &quot; ... using numerical simulations, we show that the distortions of voltage-gated K+ and Ca2+ currents are substantial even in neurons with short dendrites. The simulations also demonstrate that passive cable theory cannot be used to justify voltage-clamping of neurons, due to significant shunting to the reversal potential of the voltage-gated conductance during channel activation.

Abstract:
The abundance of nitric oxide (NO)
synthesizing enzymes identified in the vertebrate retina highlight the
importance of NO as a signaling molecule in this tissue. Here we
describe opposing actions of NO on the rod and cone photoreceptor
synapse. Depolarization-induced increases of calcium concentration
in rods and cones were enhanced and inhibited, respectively, by the
NO donor S-nitrosocysteine. NO suppressed calcium current in cones
by decreasing the maximum conductance, whereas NO facilitated rod
Ca channel activation. NO also activated a nonselective voltageindependent
conductance in both rods and cones. Suppression of NO
production in the intact retina with NG-nitro-L-arginine favored cone
over rod driven postsynaptic signals, as would be expected if NO
enhanced rod and suppressed cone synaptic activity. These findings
may imply involvement of NO in regulating the strength of rod and
cone pathways in the retina during different states of adaptation.

To use the model simply auto-launch from ModelDB or 1)download archive
and expand the zip file, 2) compile the mod files with mknrndll
(mswin) or nrnivmodl (unix/linux), and 3) start the program by double
clicking the mosinit.hoc file (mswin), or by typing nrngui mosinit.hoc

!!! Contains the MultipleRunControl a new native parameter scanning
!!! tool for NEURON.
!!! MultipleRunControl code and readme can be found in the /hoc/mrc
!!! directory.

This software is released under the GNU GPL version 3: 
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html

Purpose and Method:

This code was written to systematically investigate which of the
physical parameters controlled by dendritic morphology underlies the
differences in spiking behaviour observed in different realizations of
the 'ping-pong'-model introduced by Mainen and Sejnowski (1). Their
paper contains two variants of this dynamics one implemented on full
morphologies, on which we based the models found in the main model
file modelCellReConstruction.hoc and one reduced model on which we
based the models in modelSimplifiedCells.hoc but to which we added
topology as in earlier work by van Ooyen et al. (2,3). Structurally
varying dendritic topology and length in the simplified model allows
us to separate out the physical parameters derived from morphology
underlying burst firing. The presence of bursting is evaluated using a
measure introduced earlier by us (4) and reintroduced in the
accompanying paper, which determines whether or not the spike
intervals are drawn alternatingly from different distributions.  To
perform the parameter scans we created a new NEURON tool the Multiple
Run Control which can be used to easily set up a parameter scan and
write the simulation results to file. In the directory /hoc/mrc a
separate readme describe the usage of the multiple run control can be
found.

    
Main scientific result of the accompanying paper:

The arrival time of the return current, as measured provisionally by
the average electrotonic path length, determines whether the pyramidal
cell (with ping-pong model dynamics) will burst or fire single
spikes. This goes against the common belief that input conductance is
the determining physical parameter, as we explicitly show .
    
    
Organization of the code:

The code has been adapted from the original code to guard against
starting up time consuming simulations, to achieve this we limited the
run time and the number of points included in the scans. More
specifically we have often disabled the scanning of parameters using
dendritic stimulation, this can easily be switched back on, either
using the Multiple Run Control GUI popping up or by editing the
scripts . Furthermore we have only included part of the code used for
the paper, we were lead by three considerations for including code: is
it needed to reproduce the main findings of the paper, are there
algoritmic details involved important for checking the result, does it
demonstrate an important feature of the Multiple Run Control. If the
answer to one of these questions was yes we included the code.
    
Howto rerun some of the original experiments:
    Make sure a compiled version of the mod-files is available in the
    simulations directory. Start a terminal and cd to simulations
    directory.  (Indicated times where needed for running the code
    using NEURON 7.0 on a 1.86 GHz, (8 core), 2.5 GB computer, using
    linux kernel 2.6.30)
    
    Warning: Because of the parameter and time scans involved
    rerunning the experiments is time consuming, especially the
    parameter scans run on the simplified topologies, can easily take
    days and in the case of the meta parameters scans, despite
    application of poormans paralization, the whole experiment easily
    takes a week.

    Pruning (Figure 3):

        Part I: `Producing spike data and membrane voltage traces
        (This step may take about 40-60 minutes.)
            step 1: nrngui Pruning.ses
            step 2: On the multiple run control press `Loop Run'
            step 3: type quit() on the command line or use NEURON 
                    file menu to quit NEURON.
        Part II: Analysing the data
            step 4: start matlab and open and run Pruning.m in the
                    simulations directory
        Remarks:
            - Full figure reproduction requires generation of traces
            under dendritic stimulation aswell. On the multiple run
            control press `Loop Params', select `Edit' and double
            click on `bDendriticStimulation' and change the numbers
            from `0 0 1 0 0 0' to `0 1 1 0 0 0'. Before pressing the
            `Loop Run' button again make sure to empty the
            Pruning\Results directory.
            - Postscript figures of all the morphologies will
            generated if in the Pruning.ses script bPrintTree is set
            to 1.
            - Figure 301 shows pooled unaveraged data, Figure 302
            shows unaveraged data per seed sequence.

    ScalingReconstructed (Figure 4):
        Part I: `Producing spike data and membrane voltage traces
                (This step may take about 1 hours.)
            step 1: nrngui ScalingReconstructed.ses
            step 2: On the multiple run control press `Loop Run' 
            step 3: type quit() on the command line or use NEURON file
            menu to quit NEURON.
        Part II: Analysing the data
            step 4: start matlab and open and run
            ScalingReconstructed.m in the simulations directory
        Remarks:
            - Full figure reproduction requires generation of traces
            under dendritic stimulation aswell, this takes about (6
            hours). On the multiple run control press `Loop Params',
            select `Edit' and double click on `bDendriticStimulation'
            and change the numbers from `0 0 1 0 0 0' to `0 1 1 0 0
            0'. Before pressing the `Loop Run' button again make sure
            to empty the Pruning\Results directory.  - Postscript
            figures of all the morphologies will generated if in the
            Pruning.ses script bPrintTree is set to 1.  - Figure 401

    ReReconstructedCells (Figure 5 and 12):
        Part I: `Producing spike data and membrane voltage traces
                (This step make take about 30 minutes.)
            step 1: nrngui  ReReconstructedCells.ses
            step 2: On the multiple run control press `Loop Run' 
            step 3: type quit() on the command line or use NEURON file
            menu to quit NEURON.
        Part II: `Calculate physical quantities characterizing the
        morphology mean electronic path length, input conductance,
        dendritic membrane area (This step takes a couple of minutes.)
            step 4: nrngui  ReReconstructedCellsIC.ses
            step 5: On the multiple run control press `Loop Run' 
            step 6: type quit() on the command line or use NEURON file
            menu to quit NEURON.
        Part III: Analysing the data
            step 7: start matlab and open and run
            ReReconstructedCells.m in the simulations directory
        Remarks:
            - Full figure reproduction requires generation of traces
            under dendritic stimulation aswell, takes about 1-2
            hours. On the multiple run control press `Loop Params',
            select `Edit' and double click on `bDendriticStimulation'
            and change the numbers from `0 0 1 0 0 0' to `0 1 1 0 0
            0'. Before pressing the `Loop Run' button again make sure
            to empty the ReReconstructedCells\Results directory.
            - Postscript figures of all the morphologies will
              generated if in the ReReconstructedCells.ses script
              bPrintTree is set to 1.
            - Figure 501 shows spikes from the full runs top 7 with
            somatic stimulation, bottom 7 dendritic stimulation.
            - Figure 1201 shows how bursting depends on the tree
            (TreeNumber = Index denoting a tree) and figure 1202 shows
            how frequency depends on the tree.

    simplifiedTopologies obeying Rall's law (Figure 6, 7, 10):
        Part I: `Producing spike data and membrane voltage traces
        (This part takes about 2 days, unless you slice it and split
        it over more processors,see below.)
            step 1: nrngui  simplifiedTopologies.ses
            step 2: On the multiple run control press `Loop Run' 
            step 3: type quit() on the command line or use NEURON file
            menu to quit NEURON.
        Part II: `Calculate physical quantities characterizing the
        morphology mean electronic path length, input conductance,
        dendritic membrane area (This step takes a couple of minutes.)
            step 4: nrngui  simplifiedTopologiesIC.ses
            step 5: On the multiple run control press `Loop Run' 
            step 6: type quit() on the command line or use NEURON file
            menu to quit NEURON.
        Part III: `Generate membrane potential traces I. (This part
        takes about 30 minutes)
            step 7: nrngui   simplifiedTopologiesVTraces.ses 
            step 8: On the multiple run control press `Loop Run' 
            step 9: type quit() on the command line or use NEURON file menu
            to quit NEURON.
        Part IV: `Generate membrane potential traces II. (This part
        takes about 15 minutes)
            step 10: nrngui   simplifiedTopologiesVTraces.ses 
            step 11: On the multiple run control press `SetBasename
            for Output Files' and insert &quot;_T1&quot; after &quot;/Sim&quot; and before
            &quot;_Vtraces&quot; and `Accept'.
            step 12: On the multiple run control press `Loop Params'
            and select `Edit'. Double `currentTopologyNo' and change
            `1 23 1 0 0 0' to `1 1 1 0 0 0' and `Accept'. Then double
            click `totalDendriticLength' and change `1750 1900 150 0 0

            file menu to quit NEURON.
        Part V: Analysing the data
            step 15: start matlab and open and run
            simplifiedTopologies.m in the simulations directory
        Remarks:
            - figure 1001 and 1002 show for the same simulation
            results, burstMeasure (1001) and frequency (1002) plotted
            without offset and as a function of several physical
            quantities characterizing the morphology. Because the
            diameters fit Rall's law all these physical parameters
            have a similar developemnt and it is hard to tease out
            which parameter is the most relevant.

    simplifiedTopologies with constant diameter (Figure 8, 9 ):
        Part I: `Producing spike data and membrane voltage traces
        (This part takes about 8 hours, unless you slice it and split
        it over more processors, see below.)
            step 1: nrngui  simplifiedTopologiesDConst.ses
            step 2: On the multiple run control press `Loop Run' 
            step 3: type quit() on the command line or use NEURON file
            menu to quit NEURON.
        Part II: `Calculate physical quantities characterizing the
        morphology mean electronic path length, input conductance,
        dendritic membrane area (This step takes a couple of minutes.)
            step 4: nrngui  simplifiedTopologiesDConstIC.ses
            step 5: On the multiple run control press `Loop Run' 
            step 6: type quit() on the command line or use NEURON file
            menu to quit NEURON.
        Part V: Analysing the data
            step 15: start matlab and open and run
            simplifiedTopologies.m in the simulations directory
        Remarks: 
            - figure 901 and 902 show the same comparison as in figure
            9 but with dendritic area included for both burst measure
            (901) and frequency (902). Outside the bursting region
            input conductance is the best predictor of firing
            frequency.
            - figure 903 and 904 show for the same simulation results,
            burstMeasure (1001) and frequency (1002) plotted without
            offset and as a function of several physical quantities
            characterizing the morphology.

    Meta scan over simplifiedTopologies obeying Rall's law (Code used
    for producing Supplementary Figures 4,5,6,7):
        
        For these supplementary figures we produced 64 scsans of the
        type described just before, each scan takes about 2 days so
        clearly some kind of parallelization is needed to pull this
        off in reasonable time.
        
        Rather than reproducing the full figure we therefore show here
        how this paralellization was achieved using the
        MultipleRunControl, and give scripts that with slight
        adjusments can be used to recreate the full figures.
        
        Part I: `Producing spike data and membrane voltage traces
        (This reduced scan takes about 40 minutes, full scan takes
        several days.)
            step 1: run the shell script runparallel.sh ()
            step 2: On the multiple run control press `Loop Run' 
            step 3: type quit() on the command line or use NEURON file
            menu to quit NEURON.
        Part II:  Analysing the data
            step 4: start matlab and open and run
            simplifiedTopologiesGKCaGActScanPanels.m in the
            simulations directory
        Remarks:
            - Full figure reproduction requires adjustment of the
            ranges of topologies and lengths scanned and takes several
            days. In the files
            simplifiedTopologiesGKCaGActScanPanels.ses and
            simplifiedTopologiesGKCaGActScanPanels.m it is indicated
            what the original parameters where. Given the relative
            insensitivity of the dynamics to the amount of KCa and Km
            ionchannels, we have only included the extremes of their
            ranges in this example.
            - Numbering of figures in matlab reflects that these
            figures can be seen as figures supporting figure 6 and 7.

Using this code we found that not input conductance but the arrival time of the
return current, as measured provisionally by the average electrotonic path
length, determines whether the pyramidal cell (with ping-pong model dynamics)
will burst or fire single spikes.Reference: van Elburg RA, van Ooyen A (2010) Impact of dendritic size and dendritic topology on burst firing in pyramidal cells.  6:e1000781-

M. Migliore, E. Cook, D.B. Jaffe, D.A. Turner and D. Johnston, Computer
simulations of morphologically reconstructed CA3 hippocampal neurons, J.
Neurophysiol. 73, 1157-1168 (1995). 

The paper shows how bursting and non bursting firing modes of CA3 
neurons can depend on the densities of the Ca-independent conductances,
that prevent the build-up of the Ca-dependent depolarizing envelope
(compare bursting and short non bursting simulations).
Calcium accumulation during long current injections results in
spike adaptation modulated by Ca-dependent conductances and KM.

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui test_a.hoc

This will open a window from which three simulations using the A neuron
could be run to show bursting and non bursting firing of the same cell.


Under Windows:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll DOS box&quot; and 
follow on-screen instructions.
A double click on the simulation file
test_a.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Questions on how to use this model should be directed to

July 5th 2007 Model updated to run with Model View (1e-6 replaced 0's
in ca3a.geo) TMM
August 24th 2007 Updated to allow shape plots to be updated via
inclusion of flushPlot() in test_a.hoc TMM

   The model shows that an electrically excitable soma is not necessary for spike through-conduction in the  t-shaped geometry of a dorsal root ganglion neuron axon.  Electrical excitability of the soma is required, however, for soma spike invasion.  See papers for details and more.

  <description>
   This model, diverged from oscillatory parameters seen in live cells and failed to produce characteristic ectopic discharge patterns. Here we show that use of a more complete set of Na+ conductances--which includes several delayed components--enables simulation of the entire repertoire of oscillation-triggered electrogenic phenomena seen in live dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. This includes a physiological window of induction and natural patterns of spike discharge. An INa+ component at 2-20 ms was particularly important, even though it represented only a tiny fraction of overall INa+ amplitude. With the addition of a delayed rectifier IK+ the singlet firing seen in some DRG neurons can also be simulated. The model reveals the key conductances that underlie afferent ectopia, conductances that are potentially attractive targets in the search for more effective treatments of neuropathic pain.Reference: Kovalsky Y, Amir R, Devor M (2009) Simulation in sensory neurons reveals a key role for delayed Na+ current in subthreshold oscillations and ectopic discharge: implications for neuropathic pain.  102:1430-42

fdsintf.mod is an integrate &amp; fire cell.

fdsexpsn.mod and fdsexp2s.mod are double-exponential 
conductance-change mechanisms based on ExpSyn and Exp2Syn.

NOTES:  

1.  The important parts of this package of files are the 
synaptic mechanisms, not the &quot;cells.&quot;  The synaptic mechanisms
are reusable in models of artificial and biophysical neurons.  
The &quot;cells,&quot; however, are only the remotest abstractions of a 
V1 layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron.  The &quot;integrate and fire cell&quot; 
is not a specific representation of any particular neuron, 
and the &quot;biophysical neurons&quot; are just single compartments 
that serve as hosts for the conductance change synaptic 
mechanisms.

2.  For information about NEURON's model description language 
NMODL and how to compile mod files see the Documentation 
page at NEURON's WWW site ( http://www.neuron.yale.edu/ ), 
especially the FAQ link on that page.
 
Updated 20110810 by NTC for compatibility with recent versions 
of NEURON.

This model was implemented by Rob Morgan in the Soltesz lab at UC
Irvine.  It is a scaleable dentate gyrus model including four cell
types.  This model runs in serial (on a single processor) and has been
published at the size of 50,000 granule cells (with proportional
numbers of the other cells).

p*c.hoc: Connection probabilities for each cell type to the other cell

the filename.

*cdist.hoc: Axonal arbor distributions used in determining connection
 probabilities

50knet.hoc: Main neuron code for the network

run50knet.bash: Bash script for running the network (unix/linux).
This script needs to be modified to contain the actual paths for where
you placed the files.


********************
Running the Network

1) The mod files must first be compiled into the directory from which
you will run the network.
ex:
nrnivmodl ccanl nca tca LcaMig CaBK gskch hyperde3 bgka ichan2 Gfluct2

2) Run the file run50knet.bash.  This file does several things:
a) Creates a directory according to the number of granule cells in the
network
b) Creates a parameters.dat file in the working directory which
contains such things as the number of cells for each cell type and the
percent of network sclerosis (the network is scalable to some degree
but if you alter the number of cells, you may also have to change the
connection probabilities and synaptic weights to ensure a
well-connected network with reasonable synaptic connectivities).
c) Runs the hoc code
d) Moves the two output files, numCons.dat and spikerast.dat to the
directory that was created in (a)

** While the hoc code for running the network includes usage of the
   gui, it's highly recommended to run the program in the background
   with no graphical display for large networks.

When run in its default mode (auto-launched from ModelDB for example)
the simulation will produce (about 2 minutes after the start button is
pressed) a figure like:

A Model of Tight Junction Function In CNS Myelinated Axons

The two models included can be implemented in NEURON v5.9 or v6.2:

1) a myelinated axon is represented by an equivalent circuit with a
double cable design but includes a tight junction in parallel with the
myelin membrane RC circuit (called double cable model, DCM).

2) a myelinated axon is represented by an equivalent circuit with a
double cable design but includes a tight junction in series with the
myelin RC circuit (called tight junction model, TJM).

These models have been used to simulate data from compound action
potentials measured in mouse optic nerve from Claudin 11-null mice:

Devaux, J.J. &amp; Gow, A. (2008) Tight Junctions Potentiate The
Insulative Properties Of Small CNS Myelinated Axons. J Cell Biol 183,
909-921.

ModelDB accession number: 122442

A detailed description of the models has been submitted to Neuron Glia
Biology.

Both models were designed using CellBuilder andChannelBuilder and are
set up to simulate a small axon of 0.6um diameter with 3 wraps of
membrane in each of 20 myelin sheaths. Each .ses file includes the
active properties of the model: Nav, Kf, Ks channels and leak.

Ion concentrations (specified in Distributed Mechanisms -&gt; Managers -&gt;
Homogenous spec) are:

Na out = 160 mM
Na in   =   30 mM
K out   =  5 mM
K in     = 140 mM

Specifying axons of different sizes

An excel spreadsheet is included to enable calculation of the passive
properties for DCM and TJM axons of different diameters. Active
properties remain constant. Default values of the parameters that were
used for publication are included in the spreadsheet

1) specify the axon diameter, Di (bright yellow), optional parameters
(pale yellow), tight junction and myelin resistivities (olive). Reduce
tight junction resistivity by 10-fold to simulate an axon lacking
tight junctions

2) insert the calculated values (pink) into NEURON in the Geometry
page of CellBuilder

3) insert the calculated values (bright blue) into NEURON in the
Biophysics page (extracellular parameters)

4) insert event times from the PointProcessManagers in NEURON into the
spreadsheet (gray) to calculate CV

Reproducing fig. 6d or 6e requires running each model a couple of
times using different extracellular resistances. these resistances are
calculated using the spreadsheet.

As a starting point, I have attached 3 screenshots (in the screenshots
folder) for the TJM to generate the solid (screenshot 1)

   Two models are included:
1) a myelinated axon is represented by an equivalent circuit with a double cable design but includes a tight junction in parallel with the myelin membrane RC circuit  (called double cable model, DCM).

2) a myelinated axon is represented by an equivalent circuit with a double cable design but includes a tight junction in series with the myelin RC circuit (called tight junction model, TJM).

These models have been used to simulate data from compound action potentials measured in mouse optic nerve from Claudin 11-null mice in Fig. 6 of:

at axon branch points. J. Neurophysiol. 41: 1-8.

This model reproduces figure 2C &amp; 2D. An action potential, generated in the 
small (40 um) branch, fails to invade the large axon (250 um) on the first 
run at 7 degC but does invade when the temperature is reduced to 5 degC for
the second run. As discussed in the paper, the experimental values for the 
amplitude and rate of rise of the action potential were quite dependent on the
physiological condition of the axon. The same is true for the value of the 
critical temperature as can be seen in the simulation when the initial condition
(resting potential) is altered. For this simulation the resting potential
was depolarised from -65 to -64 mV as a consequence of changing the leakage
reversal potential from  el_hh = -50.183629 to -54.401079 (see the
init procedure in the mosinit.hoc file).

The original simulations were done with a Fortran program employing an 
extension of the implicit integration method of Crank and Nicholson written by
Joyner for a branching axon.

The NEURON implementation of this model was prepared by Michael Hines.
Questions about details of this implementation should be addressed to him
at michael.hines@yale.edu.

Fast synaptic inhibition promotes synchronized gamma oscillations in 
hippocampal interneuron networks. 
Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 99:13222-7

Abstract:
Networks of GABAergic interneurons are of critical importance for
the generation of gamma frequency oscillations in the brain. To
examine the underlying synaptic mechanisms, we made paired
recordings from basket cell (BCs) in different subfields of
hippocampal slices, using transgenic mice that express enhanced
green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the parvalbumin
promoter. Unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs)
showed large amplitude and fast time course with mean amplitude weighted
decay time constants of 2.5, 1.2, and 1.8 ms in the dentate
gyrus, and the cornu ammonis area 3 (CA3) and 1 (CA1), respectively
(33-34Â°C). The decay of unitary IPSCs at BC-BC synapses was
significantly faster than that at BC-principal cell synapses, indicating
target cell-specific differences in IPSC kinetics. In addition,
electrical coupling was found in a subset of BC-BC pairs. To
examine whether an interneuron network with fast inhibitory
synapses can act as a gamma frequency oscillator, we developed an
interneuron network model based on experimentally determined
properties. In comparison to previous interneuron network models,
our model was able to generate oscillatory activity with higher
coherence over a broad range of frequencies (20-110 Hz). In this
model, high coherence and flexibility in frequency control emerge
from the combination of synaptic properties, network structure,
and electrical coupling.

Excerpt from the paper describing the network architecture:
...
A structured interneuron network was assembled from 200
neurons arranged on the circumference of a ring with 50 um
spacing, a simple representation that avoids edge effects. Each
neuron was randomly connected to its 100 nearest neighbors by
chemical synapses; the connection probability was given by a
Gaussian function with a standard deviation of 24 cell-cell
distances and an average connection probability of 0.57. This
connectivity was consistent with published anatomical data (ref.
29; see also ref. 12). The conduction time was calculated from the
distance between pre- and postsynaptic cells along the circumference.
... Furthermore, each neuron was randomly connected to its eight 
nearest neighbors by electrical synapses with a connection 
probability of 0.5.
...

The model files reproduce images similar to those in fig 3 (takes about 
30 seconds on an 800 MHz IBM compatible). To generate fig 3A(B) set 
Imu=1(5) in netring.hoc and run nrngui mosinit.hoc again.
Note: to generate runs as similar to the paper as possible look at tstop 
comment to change tstop and also change dt to 0.01 (as shown in netring.hoc).
(will take longer to run).  The model uses a random number generator so that 
the figures you generate will always be slightly different than the paper.

To run the model auto-launch from ModelDB or download the zip file and extract
and setup in the usual way for your Mac, PC, or Unix system.  This involves
compiling the mechanisms with mknrndll (PC or MAC), or nrnivmodl (unix), and then
run nrngui mosinit.hoc.

This is the readme for the model associated with the paper

Rabinowitch I, Segev I (2006) The interplay between homeostatic
synaptic plasticity and functional dendritic compartments. J
Neurophysiol 96:276-83

These files were supplied by Dr Ithai Rabinowitch.

The basic idea is:

1. Each simulation is given a RIP number and each RIP has several
   RDPs. RIP is a list of run-independent parameters such as the type
   of active channels on the dendrites. RDP is a list of run-dependent
   parameters (e.g. the simulation time). This allows you to set up a
   general RIP configuration and then run several RDP variations on
   it. The RIP and RDP parameter panels are at the top left.

2. Even above the RIP category is the neuron structure and channel
   file which are selected just before entering the main gui.

3. There are several types of simulation programs such as EPSP (which
   measures individual EPSP amplitudes for each synapse). These are
   chosen in the panel in the bottom.

4. It is possible to pre-program the simulation to run several
   simulations in sequence (if you want to leave the computer to work
   overnight and run different simulations one after the other).

Usage:

Download and extract the archive.  Then under

unix/linux:
-----------

cd main
nrnivmodl ../mechanisms
nrngui main.hoc

In the first selection window choose Spruston2 (not 3) and in the
Migliore2 Channel layout and Segment length 20.

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=114355&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\v8sources\.\screenshot1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot 1&quot; /&gt;

Then click 'Done'.

You will be able to get 6 simulation configurations (RIP0: RDP0-5)
that do the following (the simulations are quite long):

RDP 0: runs in 'frozen' mode, i.e. no plasticity. This is used to get
a profile of the average membrane potential at each dendritic site (at
the end of the simulation choose Vavg in one of the two plot windows).

RDP 1: runs with plasticity so that at the end you also get gmax
values that are different from gmax0

RDP 2-5 start with the gmax distribution of RDP1 (since I have already
run this, their gmax0 is supposed to be stored).

RDP 2: local HSP RDP 3: frozen with the gmax0 obtained from RDP2's
final gmax.

RDP 4: global HSP RDP 5: frozen with the gmax0 obtained from RDP4's
final gmax.

---

Select &quot;artificial vivo&quot;, click &quot;add&quot; and &quot;go&quot;. While it is running
you can select Interaction -&gt; distance -&gt; gmax and Interaction -&gt;
distance -&gt; vmax in the graph windows, then your simulation will look
like this:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=114355&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\v8sources\.\screenshot2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot 2&quot; /&gt;

I would suggest that you create a new RDP and just set a much shorter
simulation time (TSTOP under the RDP list). You can then run it to
make the result files (under for example
./records/files/ri05-Migliore2-seg-1-20/RIP-0/RDP-0/ ) accessible
without having to run the whole simulation. If you want interesting
things to happen in the short time, you can change the time constant
of the plasticity mechanism. Create a new RIP configuration (or delete
the existing one) and change the time scale parameter in the synapse
parameter dialog box (just under the RIP list).

   (2006a): &quot;We investigated analytically and numerically the interplay between two opposing forms of synaptic plasticity: positive-feedback, long-term potentiation/depression (LTP/LTD), and negative-feedback, homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP).  A detailed model of a CA1 pyramidal neuron, with numerous HSP-modifiable dendritic synapses, demonstrates that HSP may have an important role in selecting which spatial patterns of LTP/LTD are to last.
...
Despite the negative-feedback nature of HSP, under both local and global HSP, numerous synaptic 
potentiations/depressions can persist. These experimentally testable results imply that HSP could be significantly involved in shaping the spatial distribution of synaptic weights in the dendrites and not just normalizing it, as is currently believed.&quot;
(2006b): &quot;Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) is an important mechanism attributed with the slow regulation of the neuron's activity. Whenever activity is chronically enhanced, HSP weakens the weights of the synapses in the dendrites and vice versa. Because dendritic morphology and its electrical properties partition the dendritic tree into functional compartments, we set out to explore the interplay between HSP and dendritic compartmentalization.
...
The spatial distribution of synaptic weights throughout the dendrites will markedly differ under the local versus global HSP mechanisms. We suggest an experimental paradigm to unravel which type of HSP mechanism operates in the dendritic tree. The answer to this question will have important implications to our understanding of the functional organization of the neuron.&quot;

   &lt;pre&gt;Neuron demo file to simulate local field potentials
---------------------------------------------------

This Neuron demo file simulates the model of local field potentials
(LFP) with variable resistivity, as described in the following paper:

 Bedard C, Kroger H and Destexhe A.  Modeling extracellular field
 potentials and the frequency-filtering properties of extracellular
 space.  Biophysical Journal 86: 1829-1842, 2004.

This paper develops a model of LFP that includes the frequency
filtering properties of extracellular space.  The paper considers
inhomogeneous conductivity and permittivity profiles, which results
from the multiple media (fluids, membranes, vessels, ...) composing
the extracellular space around neurons.  Including non-constant
profiles of conductivity enables the model to display frequency
filtering properties, ie slow events such as EPSPs/IPSPs are less
attenuated than fast events such as action potentials.

The model shown here is a reproduction of Figure 6 of the paper. 
The source current is monopolar in this simple case and consists of
an EPSP/IPSP sequence followed by an action potential (see details
in the paper).

The method to calculate the extracellular LFP consists of the 
following steps:
	  - read in the source current I from a data file
	  - compute the Fourier transform of the source current I
	  - compute the impedance Z assuming a non-homogeneous conductivity
	    function (radial symetry) - this step requires a MOD file
	    with the ImpedanceFM mechanism
	  - compute the extracellular voltage by inverse Fourier transform
	    of the product Z(w) * I(w)

Note that this demo file is provided &quot;as is&quot;, unfortunately I have
no time to help implementing, but feedbacks are always welcome if
it has been useful to you.  If you use this for your research,
please cite the above paper.

Signal propagation in Drosophila central neurons.

Abstract:

Drosophila is an important model organism for investigating neural
development, neural morphology, neurophysiology, and neural correlates
of behaviors. However, almost nothing is known about how electrical
signals propagate in Drosophila neurons. Here we address these issues
in antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs), one of the most
well-studied classes of Drosophila neurons. We use morphological and
electrophysiological data to deduce the passive membrane properties of
these neurons and to build a compartmental model of their electrotonic
structure. We find that these neurons are electrotonically extensive,
and that a somatic recording electrode can only imperfectly control
the voltage in the rest of the cell. Simulations predict that action
potentials initiate at a location distant from the soma, in the
proximal portion of the axon. Simulated synaptic input to a single
dendritic branch propagates poorly to the rest of the cell and cannot
match the size of real unitary synaptic events, but we can obtain a
good fit to data when we model unitary input synapses as dozens of re-
lease sites distributed across many dendritic branches. We also show
that the true resting potential of these neurons is more
hyperpolarized than previously thought, due to the experimental error
introduced by the electrode seal conductance. A leak sodium
conductance also contributes to the resting potential. Taken together,
these findings have fundamental implications for how these neurons
integrate their synaptic inputs. Our results also have important
consequences for the design and interpretation of experiments aimed
at understanding Drosophila neurons and neural circuits.

To run:

Remember to first compile the .mod files for your system:

mswin:
------
Run mknrndll from the NEURON program group.
Double click the mosinit.hoc file or one of the hoc files beginning
with &quot;figure...&quot;

Mac OS X:
---------
drag and drop the folder (dm1_pn_model) onto the mknrndll icon.  Drag
and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

unix/linux:
-----------
run &quot;nrnivmodl&quot; in the folder (dm1_pn_model), then &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot;.

After the simulation is started it will automatically generate plots
similar to those in the paper. The neuronal morphologies are defined
in the files dm1_morph_1.hoc, dm1_morph_2.hoc, and dm1_morph_3.hoc.
For example running figure_4a_cell1.hoc (or pressing the cell 1 button
after auto-launching from ModelDB or running mosinit.hoc) should lead
to a figure like:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=118662&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\dm1_pn_model\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;figure 4a cell 1&quot; /&gt;

   &lt;pre&gt;NEURON mod files from the paper:
Computational simulation of the input-output relationship in hippocampal
pyramidal cells
by Xiaoshen Li, Giorgio A. Ascoli
Journal of computational neuroscience, In press

The model shows how different input patterns (irregular &amp;
asynchronous, irregular &amp; synchronous, regular &amp; asynchronous, regular
&amp; synchronous) affect the neuron's output rate when 1000 synapses are
distributed in the proximal apical dendritic tree of a hippocampus CA1
pyramidal neuron. It shows four different input frequencies (1 Hz, 4
Hz, 7 Hz and 10 Hz) as shown in the paper fig5A.

In the irregular input cases (irregular asynchronous and irregular
synchronous), because the random number generated is dependent on the
seed and the seed is dependent on the simulation environment, the
simulation gives different spiking traces on each run. For the long
simulation period (2 seconds), the overall output frequency is
constant and is only related to the input frequency.

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command
nrnivmodl
and run the simulation hoc file with the command
nrngui mosinit.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
mosinit.hoc
will open the simulation window.

   &lt;pre&gt;NEURON mod files from the paper:
Activity-Dependent Adjustments of the Inhibitory Network 
in the Olfactory Bulb Following Early Postnatal Deprivation,
by Saghatelyan, A., Roux, P., Migliore, M., Rochefort, C., Desmaisons,
D., Charneau, P., Shepherd, G.M., and Lledo, P.M. 
Neuron 46:103-116, 2005.

The paper investigates the role of experience in 
sculpting neuronal network in the Olfactory bulb.
It was found that nostril closure decreased the number of
newborn granule cells of the MOB, the complexity of their dendritic arborization,
and spine density. However, due to a compensatory increase in the newborn 
granule cells excitability, the action potential-dependent GABA release was dramatically 
enhanced, counteracting thus the reduction in the spine density and leading to an 
unaltered synchronization of mitral cells firing activity.
The model supports the experimental findings, and shows that a -10mV shift in the
Na activation or a reduction in the dendritic lenght of newborn GC
could independenlty explain the observed increase in excitability. 

The effect is demonstrated here by reproducing the simulations
in Figs.6 and 8 of the paper.
3 simulations can be run for different kind of model setup:
- control conditions 
- shift in the GC Na activation. 
- reduced dendritic length of GC

   The model supports the experimental findings on the effects of postnatal odor deprivation, and shows that a -10mV shift in the
Na activation or a reduction in the dendritic length of newborn GC
could independently explain the observed increase in excitability.

This is the readme for the NQS method presented in the paper:

Lytton WW (2006) Neural Query System: Data-mining from within the
NEURON simulator. Neuroinformatics 4:163-76

The following sequence will populate the NQS database with information
from one of the models in ModelDB.  In the following I downloaded
model 44050 from ModelDB
http://senselab.med.yale.edu/senselab/ModelDB/ShowModel.asp?model=44050
'CA1 pyramidal neuron: dendritic spike initiation, Gasparini et al
2004' This gave me a zip file named modeldb.zip which is included for
convenience in this NQS archive.

unzip NQS_with_MFP_and_model.zip
// includes MFP and modeldb.zip (model accession number 44050, 2007-09-26)
cp NQS/vecst.mod modeldb
cd modeldb
nrnivmodl
setenv HOC_LIBRARY_PATH ../NQS:../MFP
    // run special; close native graphics
nrngui forfig5A.hoc 
load_file(&quot;setup.hoc&quot;)
load_file(&quot;mechs.hoc&quot;)
trunc(nq,nq2) // create the shape databases

  // At this point you may wish to explore the databases by looking at
  various NQS commands; eg

    nq.gets() // show the headers
    nq.pr(10) // show the first 10 entries
    nq2.gets() // show the headers
    nq2.pr(10) // show the first 10 entries
mechnqs(nq2)  // add in the conductance densities
  // Now the conductances have been added to nq2; look again
    nq2.gets() // show the headers
    nq2.pr(10) // show the first 10 entries

    nrfp() // will graph out the conductance densities; graph may need
           // to be translated and resized

Then hopefully you will see a result similar to fig 1 from the paper
but for the Gaspirini et al. model:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=97874&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\NQS_with_example\.\MFP\nrfp.gif&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

Note that some models may be far more complicated to load, having
several different subdirectories with mod files, hoc files and
templates.  In such cases, it is necessary to find your way around
these directories before using shape.hoc.  In general, it will be
necessary to recompile the model with vecst.mod included by moving
vecst.mod to the directory with other mod files and then reexecuting
'nrnivmodl.'  The resulting 'special' can then be run as before with
nrngui and shape.hoc can be loaded with a load_file() command.

Some models may cause failures when loading shape.hoc.  This will
occur when the underlying model to be tested defines something as an
object reference or as a number that is then used differently in
shape.hoc.  For example, shape.hoc defines a procedure p_p().  If an
underlying model executed eg 'objref p_p' or 'p_p=7.2' then an error
will occur when loading shape.hoc (This problem occurs because I have
not encapsulated shape.hoc in a template so as to protect its
variables.)

   NQS is a databasing program with a query command modeled loosely on the SQL select command.
Please see the manual NQS.pdf for details of use.
An NQS database must be populated with data to be used. This package includes MFP (model fingerprint) which provides an example of NQS use with the model provided in the modeldb folder (see readme for usage).Reference: Lytton WW (2006) Neural Query System: Data-mining from within the NEURON simulator.  4:163-76

These models were written in NEURON.  Sample use: Download and expand
the archive (zip) file. cd to the directory and run mknrndll (nrnivmodl
on unix).  Then start up the simulation with
nrngui mosinit.hoc

You should see the recreation of graphs that are similar to the model curves
in figure 6 of paper 1 above.  If you want to see a more exact recreation
change the time step to 0.025 (a larger time step of in some cases
1 ms is used in the default.ses file so that it does not take a long time
to reproduce the families of voltage clamp traces).

   These mod files supplied by Dr Raman are for the below two references. ... we modeled action potential firing by simulating eight currents directly recorded from Purkinje cells in both wild-type and (mutant) med mice.
Regular, high-frequency firing was slowed in med Purkinje neurons. In addition to disrupted sodium currents, med neurons had small
but significant changes in potassium and leak currents. Simulations indicated that these modified non-sodium currents could not
account for the reduced excitability of med cells but instead slightly facilitated spiking. The loss of NaV1.6-specific kinetics, however,
slowed simulated spontaneous activity. Together, the data suggest that across a range of conditions, sodium currents with a resurgent
component promote and accelerate firing.  See papers for more and details.References: 1.

   &lt;pre&gt;NEURON mod-files for stochastic channel gating of Ih and Na channels
for the paper

M.H.P. Kole, S. Hallerman and G.J. Stuart (2006). Single Ih Channels
in Pyramidal Neuron Dendrites: Properties, Distribution, and Impact on
Action Potential Output. The Journal of Neuroscience 26:1677-1687.

Running fig6b.hoc will generate two 25s lasting voltage traces from
the soma and the distal dendrite of a Layer 5 Pyramidal neuron. At
least the first 500ms have to be discarded to allow the cell to reach
steady state.

Running fig7d.hoc will generate a somatic voltage trace with an EPSP
after 500ms that elicits an action potential. To terminate the
simulation during the initialization with larger dt (first 200ms in
fig6b.hoc and first 400ms in fig7d.hoc) you have to kill the kernel
process nrniv manually. Note that due to the stochastic nature of the
mod files, the traces will differ from the published ones.

The mod files ih_stochastic.mod and na_stochastic.mod (see subfolder
Stochastic_Na) are newly generated NMODL files that allow the
incorporation of stochastically gating channels into morphologically
realistic cells. The kinetics of Ih were based on patch clamp data
from Layer 5 pyramidal neurons at 34 degree Celsius (for deterministic
version see Ih.mod in subfolder Stochastic_Na).

All other mod files were adopted unchanged from Mainen and Sejnowski
(1996). Ka.mod and CaT.mod were from Schaefer et al. (2003) and
syn.mod from Geiger et al. (1997). Only the na.mod was changed to
correct for an error in the trap0() function.

  <description>
   The hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) plays an important role in regulating neuronal excitability, yet its native single-channel properties in the brain are essentially unknown. Here we use variance-mean analysis to study the properties of single Ih channels in the apical dendrites of cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons in vitro. ... In contrast to the uniformly distributed single-channel conductance, Ih channel number increases exponentially with distance, reaching densities as high as approximately 550 channels/microm2 at distal dendritic sites. These high channel densities generate significant membrane voltage noise. By incorporating a stochastic model of Ih single-channel gating into a morphologically realistic model of a layer 5 neuron, we show that this channel noise is higher in distal dendritic compartments and increased threefold with a 10-fold increased single-channel conductance (6.8 pS) but constant Ih current density. ... These data suggest that, in the face of high current densities, the small single-channel conductance of Ih is critical for maintaining the fidelity of action potential output.  See paper for more and details.Reference: Kole MH, Hallermann S, Stuart GJ (2006) Single Ih channels in pyramidal neuron dendrites: properties, distribution, and impact on action potential output.  26:1677-87

   Modeling and experiments in the paper Chen K,Aradi I, Thom N,Eghbal-Ahmadi M, Baram TZ, and Soltesz I (2001) support the hypothesis that modified Ih currents strongly influence inhibitory inputs in CA1 cells and that the depolarizing shift in Ih activation plays a primary role in this process.

Axonal Na+ channels ensure fast spike activation and back-propagation
in cerebellar granule cells.
J Neurophysiol (December 10, 2008).  doi:10.1152/jn.90382.2008
 
Implementation was done by Shyam Diwakar in Neuron.

In most neurons, Na(+) channels in the axon are complemented by others
localized in the soma and dendrites to ensure spike back-propagation.
However, cerebellar granule cells are neurons with simplified
architecture, in which the dendrites are short and unbranched and a
single thin ascending axon travels toward the molecular layer before
bifurcating into parallel fibers.  Following previous indications
(Magistretti et al., 2006; Goldfarb et al., 2007), Here we show that,
in cerebellar granule cells, Na+ channels are enriched in the axon,
especially in the hillock, but almost absent from soma and dendrites.
The impact of this channel distribution on neuronal
electroresponsiveness was investigated by multi-compartmental
modeling. Numerical simulations indicated that granule cells have a
compact electrotonic structure allowing EPSPs to diffuse with little
attenuation from dendrites to axon. The spike arose almost
simultaneously along the whole axonal ascending branch and invaded the
hillock, whose activation promoted spike back-propagation with
marginal delay (&lt;200 micros) and attenuation (&lt;20 mV) into the
somato-dendritic compartment. These properties allow granule cells to
perform sub-millisecond coincidence detection of pre- and postsynaptic
activity and to rapidly activate Purkinje cells contacted by the
axonal ascending branch.


Usage instructions:

Auto-launch from ModelDB or download and extract the archive.  Then
under:

----
MSWIN

run mknrndll, cd to the archive and make the nrnmech.dll.  Then double
click on the mosinit.hoc file.

----
MAC OS X

Drag and drop the GrC folder onto the mknrndll icon.  Drag and drop
the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

----
Linux/Unix

Change directory to the GrC folder. run nrnivmodl. Then type
nrngui mosinit.hoc
----
  
After launching the model, one may insert an current clamp electrode
to see the model response as in Fig.5A in the paper.

Choosing the excitatory mossy fibers and inhibitory fibers from
control panel, it is also possible to generate synaptic patterns as
reported in Fig.10 in the paper.  See the screenshot images in the
fig10 folder for details of how to set parameters for the different
subplots in figure 10.  For example setting the parameters as in
fig10/mf0p3_300.png leads to reproducing fig 10 second from top plot:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=116835&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\GrC\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

One may also modify each synaptic terminal individually through
&quot;Companel.hoc&quot; file.


 
Attention: 

The GrC model was adapted to have 4 excitatory and 4 inhibitory
synapses as observed in many cerebellar granule cells of rats. To
reconfigure please follow changes in the correspoding hoc files.

The model files were tested on Fedora 10 Linux and on MS-Win platforms
both running Neuron version 7.0.

Variable time step(pref DASPK method) works without issues while on
Current clamp protocol. While during synaptic activation, it is
recommended to turn it off.

   A detailed multicompartmental model was used to study neuronal electroresponsiveness of cerebellar granule cells in rats.

   &lt;pre&gt;This model is associated with the paper:

 Tsutsui H, Oka Y.
 Slow removal of Na(+) channel inactivation underlies the temporal filtering
 property in the teleost thalamic neurons.
 J Physiol 2002 Mar 15;539(Pt 3):743-53.

The authors found a novel Na current in teleost thalamic nuclei was well 
described by the m^3 h Hodgkin-Huxley model. The kinetic parameters derived 
from their experiments (see the reference for details) revealed that the 
h gate had a large time constant (~100ms at -80 to -50mV). This explains the 
thalamic neurons long refractory period and the gradual recovery of AP 
amplitude as the inter spike interval grows. 

To run it is easiest to autolaunch and select the figure 6A,6B, or 7A.

Otherwise follow the usual procedure of downloading the zip file,
extracting, and compiling the mod file with mknrndll, or nrnivmodl
depending on whether using windows, mac, or unix.

Then run mosinit.hoc with nrngui in the usual way for your system
(typing on the command line, draggin and dropping or double clicking)

bug: that repetitions of fig 7A produces an error has been noted.

A panel allows the parameters p, q, r, g_pg, g_sp, g_sd, alpha_s and alpha_g
to be varied.

Please note there are some typos in the paper:
(1) The current balance equation for Vd should be
	Cm Vd' = -Ileak - INa - IKfast + (gsd/s)(Vs-Vd)
    not
	Cm Vd' = -Ileak - INa - IKfast - (gsd/s)(Vs-Vd)

(2) In Table 1, g_pg should be 4.08 x 10^-4, not 4.08 x 10^-3

   A four-compartment model of a mammalian olfactory bulb mitral cell, reduced 
from the complex 286-compartment model described by Bhalla and Bower (1993).  
The compartments are soma/axon, secondary dendrites, primary dendrite shaft 
and primary dendrite tuft. The reduced model runs 75 or more times faster 
than the full model, making its use in large, realistic network models of the 
olfactory bulb practical.Reference: Davison AP, Feng J, Brown D (2000) A reduced compartmental model of the mitral cell for use in network models of the olfactory bulb. Brain Res Bull 51:393-9

   &lt;pre&gt;NEURON mod files from the paper:

Mercer JN, Chan CS, Tkatch T, Held J, Surmeier DJ. Nav1.6 sodium
channels are critical to pacemaking and fast spiking in globus
pallidus neurons.,J Neurosci. 2007 Dec 5;27(49):13552-66.

This is the model demonstrated in Figures 9.B-C &amp; 10.A-B:

Figure 9. Two Na+ channel model of wild-type and Nav1.6 null
neurons. B, Voltage records from a representative GPe neuron were used
as voltage commands to estimate the availability (as sum of channels
in the O and C1&amp;ndash;5 states) of model Na+ channels. Action potentials
were truncated for clarity. C, Steady-state availability of modNav1.1
(red) and modNav1.6 (blue) channels during basal autonomous firing at
12 Hz (left), as well as that during driven activity (with
intracellular current pulses) at 50 Hz.


Figure 10. Simulations suggest that Nav1.6 channels are critical to
fast spiking but not pacemaking. A, Autonomous activity in a model of
a GPe neuron. Top trace, Spiking of the model wild-type neuron at 12
Hz when the complete complement of Na+ channels is present. Middle
trace, Spiking of the model neuron is reduced to 5 Hz when model
Nav1.6 channels are simply deleted from the model. Bottom trace,
Spiking of the model neuron is restored to near that of the wild-type
model when Na+ channel density is maintained by replacing model Nav1.6
channels with model Nav1.1 channels. B, The response of the same three
models to a current ramp delivered to the soma. In the wild-type
model, the maximum discharge rate was near 100 Hz. In contrast, the
model in which Nav1.6 channels were deleted failed to fire at a high
frequency (middle); maintaining Na+ channel density by replacing
Nav1.6 channels improved the performance of the model, but the peak
discharge rate was still well below that of the wild-type model with
modNav1.6 channels (bottom).

Sample model usage: (Note, you will have re-launch the model between
running Figure 9 &amp; 10, and vice versa.)


Figure 9 - The run includes a period of autonomous firing at about 12
Hz followed by a period of driven activity at about 50 Hz.

Figure 10 - The run includes a current injection ramp of 1 nA over the
last 1 second. The data in the figure are based on the steady state
condition before the ramp.

To delete the Nav1.6 channels, use the &quot;Remove Na1.6&quot; button.  To
replace Nav1.6 channels with Nav1.1 channels, use the &quot;Replace Na1.6&quot;
button.

Usage:

There are a one dimensional and a two dimensional model in directories
with those names.  Here are the directions for each:

One Dimensional:

* Open the file &quot;demo.hoc&quot;

* Press &quot;Init &amp; Run&quot; in the RunControl window.

*         A movie presenting the membrane potential along the axon
*         fiber will appear in the Graph[3] window. Notice that the
*         stimulation amplitude default is set to 30 volts agreeing
*         with the subthreshold activity.  You can control the
*         electrical circuit and stimulation parameters in the
*         Magnetic Coil Current window. Changing the stimulation
*         amplitude to a value higher than 36 volt will present a
*         superthreshold activity.

* In addition to the movie graph, the pulse shape is presented in
          Graph window and the membrane potential in the soma as a
          function of time is presented in Graph[2].


Two dimensional:

* Open the folder &quot;fieldCalc&quot;.

* Open the file &quot;fieldGUI.m&quot; with MATLAB program.

* type &quot;fieldGUI&quot; in the commend window and press enter.

* A window named &quot;fieldGUI&quot; will appear. Enter the coil parameters
          into the three text boxes:

o Coil radius in meters.

o Number of coiling (loops).

o Distance of the cell from the coil (Z) in meters.

* Press the &quot;show graph&quot; bottom and two graphs will appear below, the
          induced electric field in x direction (E_x ) on the left and
          the induced electric field in the y direction of the left
          (E_y ). This will take 60-90 minutes. The matrixes of the
          two graph will also be saved in the folder &quot;fieldCalc&quot; as
          text files.

* Copy the text files (ex.txt and ey.txt) into the folder named
          &quot;Neuron&quot;.

* Open the file &quot;BACModel_mag.hoc&quot; located in the &quot;Neuron&quot; folder.

* The first figure that opens shows the soma membrane potential as a
          function of time. The second shows the pulse shape.

* To run the program press the &quot;Init &amp; Run&quot; bottom in the &quot;RunControl&quot;
          panel.

* You can control the electrical circuit and stimulation parameters in
          the Magnetic Coil Current window. Changing the stimulation
          amplitude to a value higher than 1900 volt will present a
          superthreshold activity.

* To manufacture a shape plot:

o go to NEURON main menu

o click on graph - shape plot. A window showing the cell morphology
will appear.  o Right click in the window and chose the option shape
plot.

* The cell in the window will be colored according to the membrane
          potential in every location. A scale bar will also appear
          next to it, presenting the voltage matching the different
          colors. To start the movie press the &quot;Init &amp; Run&quot; bottom in
          the &quot;RunControl&quot; panel.

   Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a widely applied tool for probing cognitive function in humans and is one of the best tools for clinical treatments and interfering with cognitive tasks. Surprisingly, while TMS has been commercially available for decades, the cellular mechanisms underlying magnetic stimulation remain unclear. Here we investigate these mechanisms using compartmental modeling. We generated a numerical scheme allowing simulation of the physiological response to magnetic stimulation of neurons with arbitrary morphologies and active properties. Computational experiments using this scheme suggested that TMS affects neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) primarily by somatic stimulation.Reference: Pashut T, Wolfus S, Friedman A, Lavidor M, Bar-Gad I, Yeshurun Y, Korngreen A (2011) Mechanisms of Magnetic Stimulation of Central Nervous System Neurons.  7(3):e1002022-

This is the readme for the model for the paper:

Lytton WW; Neymotin SA; Hines ML. The virtual slice setup.  J.
Neurosci Methods. 171:309-15.  PMID: 18452996, 2008.

This model will only run under unix/linux.
How to run:
  nrnivmodl
  nrngui mosinit.hoc

leads user through a demo of major features
turn off demo by setting 'showdemo=0' at top of mosinit.hoc

note 'Help' button at bottom of major menu 'Slice'

generated windows are not arranged since I found that my default
placements ended up off the screen for some users

while the slice runs the modeler can control the simulation
interactively through control panels and graphs of activity are
displayed:

   &quot;In an effort to design a simulation environment that is more similar to that of neurophysiology, we introduce a virtual slice setup in the NEURON simulator. 

The virtual slice setup runs continuously and permits parameter changes, including changes to synaptic weights and time course and to intrinsic cell properties. 

The virtual slice setup permits shocks to be applied at chosen locations and activity to be sampled intra- or extracellularly from chosen locations. ...&quot;Reference: Lytton WW, Neymotin SA, Hines ML (2008) The virtual slice setup.  171:309-15

Book Description: 
This manual and disk, available in IBM PC and Macintosh formats, accompanies 
Shepherd's Neurobiology, 3/e. It can be used separately even though it is 
keyed to the textbook. The 17 experiments investigate such areas as the 
resting membrane potential, action potential, voltage clamp, physiological 
properties of nerve cells, and synaptic potentials. The program allows 
students to propagate the action potential, adjust various parameters and 
observe the effects on nerve cell firing. Students will learn about 
equilibrium potentials and the effects of changing ion concentrations, as 
well as passive and active membrane properties. Separate experiments analyze 
sodium ion and potassium ion currents, the voltage dependence of these 
currents, and sleep vs. waking in single neurons. Study questions are provided 
throughout. This ingeniously-designed program will benefit all undergraduate 
students of neuroscience.

    NEURON TUTORIAL FOR IMPLEMENTING SIMULATIONS OF SYNAPTIC CURRENTS

This package is running with the NEURON simulation program written by Michael
Hines and available on internet at:
  http://www.neuro.duke.edu/neuron/home.html

The package contains mechanisms (.mod files) and programs (.oc files) needed
to simulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents corresponding to the
most common types of postsynaptic receptors (glutamate AMPA and NMDA, GABA-A
and GABA-B).  The &quot;detailed&quot; simulations include multistate kinetic models and
a model for the release of transmitter.  The &quot;minimal&quot; models use the simplest
kinetic schemes but are computationally much faster while still capturing the
most salient features of synaptic interactions.  The latter are well suited
for being implemented in network simulations.

The models given here are described in detail in the following paper:

  Destexhe, A., Mainen, Z.F. and Sejnowski, T.J.  Biophysical models of 
  synaptic transmission.  In: Methods in Neuronal Modeling (2nd edition; 
  edited by Koch, C. and Segev, I.), MIT press, Cambridge, 1998, pp. 1-25.

An electronic version of this paper is available at  http://cns.iaf.cnrs-gif.fr

   Application to AMPA, NMDA, GABAA, and GABAB receptors is given in a book chapter. The reference paper synthesizes a comprehensive general description of synaptic transmission with Markov kinetic models.  This framework is applicable to modeling ion channels, synaptic release, and all receptors. Please see the references for more details. A simple introduction to this method is given in a seperate paper Destexhe et al Neural Comput 6:14-18 , 1994).

The example simulations produce results similar to those seen in
Figures 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Differences may be due to details of
antidromic stimulation not specified in the paper.

   &lt;pre&gt;This model is associated with the paper:

A model of spike initiation in neocortical pyramidal neurons 
Z. F. Mainen, J. Joerges, J. R. Huguenard and T. J. Sejnowski 
Neuron 15, 1427-1439 (1995)


Please see 

http://www.cnl.salk.edu/~zach/methods.html

where a full text (postscript format) copy of the paper
and copies of the model for early versions of neuron is available.

This model contains compartmental models of a reconstructed neocortical
neuron with active dendritic currents using NEURON. This paper examines
the paradox that although spikes can back-propagate from the soma into dendrites 
with spike amplitudes maintained in dendrites by voltage-gated channels it rarely
occurs that spikes are initiated in dendrites in these cells. The model suggests
that dendritic channel inactivation and source-load considerations are contributing
factors. See the paper for more details.

This package is written in the NEURON simulation program written by Michael
Hines and available on internet at:
http://www.neuron.yale.edu/


  HOW TO RUN (under NEURON version 5 and higher)
  =========================================

To compile the demo, NEURON and INTERVIEWS must be installed and working on
the machine you are using.

When the spikeinit.zip file is unzipped it creates a spikeinit directory which
contains the hoc and mod NEURON program files.  Change directory to spikeinit.

under UNIX:
===========

Just type &quot;nrnivmodl&quot; to compile the mechanisms
given in the mod files in the  directory.

Execute the first figure demo program by typing:

nrngui demo.hoc

continue below under back to any platform:

under MS WINDOWS (PC):
======================

Press Start button (lower left corner) and then press Programs and then
NEURON and then mknrndll.  Change directory to where the zip file was
unzipped and enter the directory that came with the zip file (spikeinit).
Press the nrnmech.dll button.

You can start the simulation by a double click on
demo.hoc
in windows explorer.

The simulation produces fig 3 from the paper.

How to use:

First install the neuron simulator if you have not already:
http://www.neuron.yale.edu

To start the simulation:

On Macintosh computers:

   Download the zip file.
   Drag it onto the mos2nrn application icon.

On PC's or UNIX:

   Auto-launch the program from the model description page in modelDB.
   (or download, extract the zip file; compile with mknrndll;  Clicking on
   the mosinit.hoc file on the pc or typing nrngui mosinit.hoc under
   unix will start the simulation)

----------------------------------

Once the default simulation is started you can
1)click on the Voltage Space Plot and then
2)click on the Fig 6 button.

Action potentials are shown propagating down the stimulated
axon and then occasionally reflecting back down this stimulated
axon and also propagating into the thick axon and the thin posterior
axon.  See paper for details. Note that the AP's travel faster in 
thicker axons than thiner axons.

If you wish to slow down the simulation 
3) click on high resolution (after stopping the model from the
   run control page if it is not already stopped)
4) click on the Fig 6 button to start again.

   This model by Stephen Baccus explores the phenomena of action potential (AP) propagation at branch boints in axons. APs are sometimes transmitted down the efferent processes and sometimes are reflected back to the axon of AP origin or neither. See the paper for details. The model zip file contains a readme.txt which list introductory steps to follow to run the simulation.

Ingemar Jacobson contributed this model with the comment
&quot;...  Following
compilation the model can be launched from the startatrial1.hoc file -
you then just need to start the simulation - I suggest with the
variable time step ticked. I had some problems with the intracellular
Ca2+-dynamics and for = clarity I had to split it into several files -
now it works reasonably well also for CVODE.  Having defined the model
files of the various cardiac currents it is an easy task to convert
the atrial model to more or less any other cardiac cell type. 
Hopefully this will be of some use for cardiac electrophysiogists. 
...&quot;
and also
&quot;...
 Perhaps some of the model files can serve as templates for neuronal
channels- the molecular correlate for the cardiac Ito is Kv4.3, for IKur
it is Kv1.5; for IKr - it is HERG, all these being potassium channels
you will find in the CNS.
 ...&quot;

Questions about the model should be directed to the original authors.
Questions about the computer implementation should be directed to
Dr. Jacobson. Questions about the database presentation should be
directed to Michael Hines. Following is a slightly expanded copy of
the &quot;about&quot; screen that pops up when the model is executed.
Running the model via the mosinit.hoc file (executed automatically by the
autolaunch process) will generate the heart action potential
shown in the ap.gif file.

The model is based on the paper by

Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 1998 275: H301-H321.

and conductance values are adjusted to give appropriate current
densities.  Pumps, exchangers and an additional electroneutral ion
accumulation mechanism are sat so that ion concentrations are stable at
a pacing rate of 1 Hz. 

The kinetics of IKur is modified to fit data of
 Feng et al Am J Physiol 1998 275(Heart Circ Physiol 44):H1717-H1725.

The possibility to include a nonspecific cation-current with kinetics
similar to IKur is also given in the IKur mechanism For the
intracellular Ca dynamics to work the mechanisms Cadynam, ca_jsr,
Ca_jsracc and ca_nsracc have to be inserted.  For simulation of
intracellular Na+-ion and K+-ion changes the mechanisms Na_acc and K_acc
have to be inserted.  The model is free to use provided acknowledgement
is given to the developers of NEURON

   &lt;pre&gt;Note: This model only runs under UNIX (and linux) for the
current version of neuron (5.2).  Future versions of neuron for the
mac and pc will be able to run this model.

* simulation from:
Lytton WW. Computer model of clonazepam's effect in thalamic slice. 
Neuroreport, 8:3339-3343, 1997.

neurrep8:3339.pdf

This simulation is very similar to the one published in the paper
  but is not identical due to variations among randomizers using
  supposedly identical algorithms.  The original was run under Sun
  Solaris.  The example files included here were produced under
  Intel Linux.  I have chosen traces from the current runs that are
  very similar to those in the publication.  However, these specific
  traces may not look identical if a different randomizer is used.
  I also graph all 64 traces from the network so that they can all
  be looked at and compared to the figure.

* COMPILE and RUN:
  nrnivmodl
RUN: 
  $CPU/special init.hoc -

* TO JUST LOOK AT PRE-SAVED DATA

   Demonstration of the effect of a minor pharmacological synaptic
change at the network level.  Clonazepam, a benzodiazepine, enhances
inhibition but is paradoxically useful for certain types of
seizures.  This simulation shows how inhibition of

effect.Reference: Lytton WW (1997) Computer model of clonazepam's effect in thalamic slice.  8:3339-43

   &lt;pre&gt;NEURON files from the paper:

Single neuron binding properties and the magical number 7,
by M. Migliore, G. Novara, D. Tegolo, Hippocampus, in press (2008).

In an extensive series of simulations with realistic morphologies and active properties, 
we demonstrate how n radial (oblique) dendrites of these neurons may be used to bind n inputs 
to generate an output signal. 
The results suggest a possible neural code as the most effective n-ple of dendrites that 
can be used for short-term memory recollection of persons, objects, or places. 
Our analysis predicts a straightforward physiological explanation for the observed 
puzzling limit of about 7 short-term memory items that can be stored by humans.

The hoc file reproduces the results in Fig.2
Face.exe is an interactive simplified demo of the simulations described in
the paper.

To use the demo, run face.exe.

Use the cursors to select any combination of eyes, nose, and mouth.
&quot;Save Code&quot; to save the configuration, and &quot;Run Simulation&quot; to run the
simulation.

Use again the cursors to test a different configuration then &quot;Save
Code&quot;, and click on the &quot;runm - refresh&quot; button on the NEURON panel to
run a simulation with the new configuration of eyes, nose and mouth.

Any configuration will activate the same 3 obliques at t=100ms, 
but with different synaptic weights (stored in sinapsi_weights.txt). 
Only the configuration activating three yellow asterisks below the face
will generate a somatic AP. 

Running the 2ap-distr-c62564AP.hoc will result in a simulation
using the synaptic weights in sinapsi_weights.txt.

Small world networks of model neurons from the paper

Andrew Bogaard, Jack Parent, Michal Zochowski, and Victoria Booth
Interaction of Cellular and Network Mechanisms in Spatiotemporal
Pattern Formation in Neuronal Networks J. Neurosci. 29: 1677-1687;
doi:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5218-08.2009

Implemented with NEURON 5.9, four model neurons with varying
excitability properties affect the spatiotemporal patterning of small
world networks of homogeneous and heterogeneous cell population.

Usage:

Either autolaunch from ModelDB after NEURON is installed or

1. Unzip bogaard2009.zip into an empty directory
2. Compile mod files
3. Double click on either homrun.hoc or hetrun.hoc to run homogeneous
or heterogeneous networks, respectively. Each should finish in a
matter of minutes (25 secs on a 2.4 MHz dual intel P8600), depending
on computer speed.

homrun.hoc will generate

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=121259&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\bogaard2009\.\screenshothom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot of homog. run&quot; /&gt;

and hetrun.hoc will generate

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=121259&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\bogaard2009\.\screenshothet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot of heter. run&quot; /&gt;


How to Compile Mod Files
unix: use command nrnivmodl
windows: run mknrndll.hoc and follow instructions

homrun.hoc              Print to screen raster plots depicting
differing activity of four homogeneous networks with different cell
composition for same network parameters.
hetrun.hoc              Print to screen raster plot of switching
activity similar to that in Fig 8.E
modelspecs.hoc  	Model neuron templates
homrig.hoc		Homogeneous network source code
hetrig.hoc		Heterogeneous network source code

Discrepancies in publication/supplemental material:

I_Kdr gating variable is described as n^4, but is n (to the first
power) in the model.

Dendrite radius is given as 12um, but the diameter is 12um in the
model.

I_Na gating variable m time constant is given as .2ms, but is .02 in
the model.

The K_A equation which reads (1 + exp(V + 40)/5))^-1 is missing a
parenthesis and should read (1 + exp((V + 40)/5))^-1.

g_Ih for cells A and B are switched in Table 1.

g_IKdr for cell A is given as .2S/cm^2 but is .1 in the model.

Figure 1 indicates indicates unit mA, which should be nA.

Alzheimer's: a computational study Front. Neural Circuits 4:16
&lt;/a&gt;

The model code was contributed by Tom Morse.  It was created (see
paper for details) from earlier models (especially Migliore et
al. 2005 and calcium channels from Hemond et al. 2008) with
modifications and additions by Tom Morse and Ted Carnevale with
interaction with the other authors. It requires the NEURON simulator
to be installed (available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neuron.yale.edu&quot;&gt;http://www.neuron.yale.edu&lt;/a&gt;).

To recreate figures from the paper, start the simulator by
auto-launching from ModelDB *OR*

Under unix systems:
-------------------
In the expanded archive's folder compile the mod files using the
command &quot;nrnivmodl&quot;
run the simulation with the command &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot;

Under Windows systems:
----------------------
Compile the mod files using the &quot;mknrndll&quot; program.
A double click on the simulation file
mosinit.hoc
will open the simulation window.

Under MAC OS X:
---------------
drag and drop the expanded archive's folder onto the mknrndll icon.
drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

Once the simulation is started click on a button to recreate a figure
from the paper, e.g.:

Figure 1,2 generates Figure 1B and 2 simultaneously:
(the simulation part is Figure 1B right hand side traces):
&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=87284&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\CA1_abeta\.\fig1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1B right hand side&quot; /&gt;

Figure 3 (example):
&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=87284&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\CA1_abeta\.\fig3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 3&quot; /&gt;

Figure 4:
&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=87284&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\CA1_abeta\.\fig4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 4&quot; /&gt;

Vijayalakshmi Santhakumar, Ildiko Aradi and Ivan Soltesz
Role of Mossy Fiber Sprouting and Mossy Cell Loss in
Hyperexcitability:A Network Model of the Dentate Gyrus Incorporating
Cell Types and Axonal Topography
J Neurophysiol 93: 437-453, 2005.

Mossy cell loss and mossy fiber sprouting are two characteristic
consequences of repeated seizures and head trauma. However, their
precise contributions to the hyperexcitable state are not well
understood. Because it is difficult, and frequently impossible, to
independently examine using experimental techniques whether it is the
loss of mossy cells or the sprouting of mossy fibers that leads to
dentate hyperexcitability, we built a biophysically realistic and
anatomically representative computational model of the dentate gyrus
to examine this question. The 527-cell model, containing granule,
mossy, basket, and hilar cells with axonal projections to the
perforant-path termination zone, showed that even weak mossy fiber
sprouting (10-15% of the strong sprouting observed in the pilocarpine
model of epilepsy) resulted in the spread of seizure-like activity to
the adjacent model hippocampal laminae after focal stimulation of the
perforant path. The simulations also indicated that the spatially
restricted, lamellar distribution of the sprouted mossy fiber
contacts reported in in vivo studies was an important factor in
sustaining seizure-like activity in the network. In contrast to the
robust hyperexcitability-inducing effects of mossy fiber sprouting,
removal of mossy cells resulted in decreased granule cell responses
to perforant-path activation in agreement with recent experimental
data. These results indicate the crucial role of mossy fiber
sprouting even in situations where there is only relatively weak
mossy fiber sprouting as is the case after moderate concussive
experimental head injury.

Usage:
Compile the NEURON mod files with nrnivmodl (unix) or mknrndll (mac
or mswin) and then start the network simulation with
nrngui mosinit.hoc
(unix) or double clicking on the mosinit.hoc file (mac or mswin).

&lt;pre&gt;

The initial network connections takes 5 minutes (prints to the oc
prompt window), then the network starts running and begins to generate
the above traces graph.  The activity graph is created at the end
of the simulation (a little over twenty minutes to finish on a
1 GHz Linux Pentium).  Note: a processor time seeded random number
generator makes every run different (for statistical analysis).

Running the kinetics.hoc simulation file will show 
the activation and inactivation steady-states, the time constants, 
and a family of curves generated modeling the same protocols 
used for Figs.5A-6A-7A of the paper.

Markers show a few of the experimental values for
the time constants derived from Figs.5C-6C-7C-7D.

For both the fast and slow KDR currents an inactivation time constant of
1sec is assumed. KA recovery from inactivation is not implemented.

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui kinetics.hoc

Under Windows:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
kinetics.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

M.Migliore and Gordon M. Shepherd
Emerging rules for distributions of active dendritic properties
underlying specific neuronal functions
Nature Rev. Neurosci. 3, 362-370, 2002.

The model illustrates how two different dendritic locations
for synaptic inputs may result in different temporal integration
windows. Running the fig1a.hoc simulation will open two windows,
from which 4 simulations can be run, corresponding
to different dendritic locations for two synapses, S1 and S2.
In one of the simulations the effects of a dendritic Ih can also be
appreciated.
To reduce simulation times, a reduced model is used rather than
a detailed CA1 geometry as in the paper.
The top window will show the time course of the 
membrane potential in a proximal location
during several simulations using different relative activation times
for S1 and S2. The symbol marks the S1 activation time. 

The bottom window will summarize the results by plotting the
peak membrane potential reached in each simulation as a function
of the relative activation times.

To compile the mod files on a unix system use the command nrnivmodl.
Under Windows, use &quot;mknrndll&quot; from the NEURON program menu
and follow on-screen instructions.

This simulation was tested/developed on LINUX systems, but may run on
Microsoft Windows or Mac OS.

To run, you will need the NEURON simulator (available at
http://www.neuron.yale.edu) compiled with python enabled.

Unzip the contents of the zip file to a new directory.

compile the mod files from the command line with:
 nrnivmodl *.mod

That will produce an architecture-dependent folder with a script
called special.  On 64 bit systems the folder is x86_64. To run the
simulation from the command line:
 ./x86_64/special -python mosinit.py

then NEURON will start with the python interpreter and load the
mechanisms and simulation. Next, the network and inputs will be setup.
Then the simulation will be run for 3 seconds of simulation time. The
simulation consists of 3 periods: 0-1000 ms (baseline), 1000ms-2000ms
(simulated ketamine application), 2000ms-3000ms (return to
baseline). The simulation duration is modifiable via the h.tstop
parameter in params.py. Note that setup of the network may take 10-30
seconds, depending on your processor speed and amount of RAM. Once the
simulation has run, two graphs will be displayed,

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=139421&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\hpcdemo\.\screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

showing the spike raster and local field potential.  The spike raster
is arranged with y-axis as cell identifier and x-axis as time in
milliseconds.  The y-axis is further arranged in order of cell-types
(red=pyramidal, green=basket, blue=OLM). The LFP and raster displayed
with the demo are a shortened version of figure 7, which has this
caption, &quot;Ketamine effect on network firing.  Raster (top) and LFP
(bottom) for baseline and ketamine application between the dashed
lines.&quot; There are no dashed lines displayed in the demo, but the
ketamine is applied between 1e3 - 2e3 milliseconds.

   &quot;Abnormalities in oscillations have been suggested to play a role in schizophrenia. 

We studied theta-modulated gamma oscillations in a computer model of hippocampal CA3 in vivo with and
without simulated application of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist and psychotomimetic.

Networks of 1200 multi-compartment neurons (pyramidal, basket and oriens-lacunosum moleculare,
OLM, cells) generated theta and gamma oscillations from intrinsic network dynamics: basket cells
primarily generated gamma and amplified theta, while OLM cells strongly contributed to theta.

channels and simulated light response in rod photoreceptors. Ann
Biomed Eng 32:1428-42

Abstract:

Rod photoreceptors express a unique type of noninactivating potassium
channels, Kx channels, which play an important role in setting the
dark potential and participate in shaping the light
response. Biophysical studies of Kx channels are limited. For example,
the effects of a conventional blocker of potassium channels,
tetraethylammonium (TEA), on Kx channels have not been extensively
studied. Here we demonstrate that TEA blocks Kx channels, one molecule
of TEA being sufficient to block the channel. Half of the Kx current
was inhibited at K0.5 = 5.6 mM. The TEA-induced block of Kx channels
depended on extracellular potassium: the higher the potassium
concentration, the stronger the block. Using TEA, we blocked potassium
channels to reveal their role in shaping the simulated light response
(SLR) of rods. We showed that TEA slowed down SLR and sometimes caused
generation of action potentials. We developed a complete computer
model of the rod, which accurately reproduced the main features of the
light response and allowed us to demonstrate that it was suppression
of Kx channels that was essential for slowing SLR and increasing
excitability of rods. The results reported in this work further
establish the importance of Kx channels in rod photoreceptor function.

How to use the model:

Simply auto-launch from ModelDB or 1)download archive and expand the
zip file, 2) compile the mod files with mknrndll (mswin) or nrnivmodl
(unix/linux), and 3) start the program by double clicking the
mosinit.hoc file (mswin), or by typing nrngui mosinit.hoc (unix).

   &lt;pre&gt;&quot;A Computational Model of the Ribbon Synapse&quot;

A model of the ribbon synapse was developed to replicate both pre- 
and postsynaptic functions of this glutamatergic juncture. The 
presynaptic portion of the model is rich in anatomical and 
physiological detail and includes multiple release sites for each
ribbon based on anatomical studies of presynaptic terminals, 
presynaptic voltage at the terminal, the activation of voltage-gated
calcium channels and a calcium-dependent release mechanism whose 
rate varies as a function of the calcium concentration that is 
monitored at two different sites which control both  an ultrafast,
docked pool of vesicles and a release ready pool of tethered 
vesicles. The postsynaptic portion of the program models diffusion of
glutamate and the physiological properties of glutamatergic 
neurotransmission in target cells. We demonstrate the behavior of the
model using the retinal bipolar cell to ganglion cell ribbon synapse.
The model was constrained by the anatomy of salamander bipolar
terminals based on the ultrastructure of these synapses and 
presynaptic contacts were placed onto realistic ganglion cell 
morphology activated by a range of ribbon synapses (46-138). 
These inputs could excite the cell in a manner consistent with 
physiological observations. This model is a comprehensive, first 
generation attempt to assemble our present understanding of the 
ribbon synapse into a domain that permits testing our understanding
of this important structure. We believe that with minor 
modifications of this model it can be fine tuned for other ribbons 
synapses.

Figures 7-11 of &quot;A Computational Model of the Ribbon Synapse&quot; can be 
replicated with this code. After compiling all MOD files load the 
appropriate HOC file (fig7.hoc, fig8.hoc, or fig9-11.hoc) from the
neuron main menu after starting nrngui or by either double clicking 
in mswin's window explorer or typing nrngui filename.hoc
in unix.

Session files are called by the HOC file, except for fig8, where 
there are 4 different SES files.  The session files contain 
instructions for running the simulation which are displayed in
a message in a graph when run.

   &quot;To better understand the direct effects of DBS (Deep brain stimulation) on central neurons, a computational model of a myelinated axon has been constructed which includes the effects of K+ accumulation within the peri-axonal space.
Using best estimates of anatomic and electrogenic model parameters for in vivo STN axons, the model predicts a functional block along the axon due to K+ accumulation in the submyelin space.
...
These results suggest that therapeutic DBS of the STN likely results in a functional block for many STN axons, although a subset of STN axons may also be activated at the stimulating frequency.

This package is running with the NEURON simulation program written by Michael
Hines and available on internet at:
  http://www.neuron.yale.edu

The package contains mechanisms (.mod files) and programs (.oc files) needed 
to simulate synaptic background activity similar to in vivo measurements
using a model of fluctuating synaptic conductances.  This &quot;point-conductance&quot;
model recreates in-vivo-like membrane parameters, such as the depolarized
membrane potential, the low input resistance and high-amplitude membrane
potential fluctuations.  All details are given in the following paper:

   This model (and experiments) reported in Destexhe, Rudolh, Fellous, and Sejnowski (2001) support the hypothesis that many of the
characteristics of cortical neurons in vivo can be explained by fast glutamatergic and GABAergic conductances varying stochastically.

Some of these cortical neuron characteristics of fluctuating synaptic origin are a depolarized membrane potential, the
presence of high-amplitude membrane potential fluctuations, a low input resistance and irregular spontaneous firing activity. In addition, the
point-conductance model could simulate the enhancement of responsiveness due to background activity.

M. Migliore, M. Hines and GM Shepherd
The role of distal dendritic gap junctions in synchronization
of mitral cell axonal output, J. Comput. Neurosci., 18:151-161 (2005).

In a realistic model of two electrically connected mitral cells (M1, M2),
the paper shows that the somatically-measured experimental properties 
of GJs may correspond to a variety of different local coupling strengths 
and dendritic distributions of GJs in the tuft. The model suggests 
that the propagation of the GJ-induced local tuft depolarization
is a major mechanim for intraglomerular synchronization of mitral cells.

The main effect is demonstrated here by reproducing the simulations
in Fig.6A-B-C of the paper.

In each case the somatic membrane potential of M1 and M2
and the gap current are shown for the first 300ms of simulation.
At the end of each run the cross-correlation function for 
the last 150ms of simulation is calculated and plotted in an interactive window.

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui forfig6-modeldb.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
forfig6-modeldb.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Safronov BV, Wolff M, Vogel W
Excitability of the Soma in Central Nervous System Neurons
Biophysical Journal Volume 78 June 2000 2998&amp;ndash;3010

ABSTRACT

The ability of the soma of a spinal dorsal horn neuron, a spinal ventral 
horn neuron (presumably a motoneuron), and a hippocampal pyramidal neuron to 
generate action potentials was studied using patch-clamp recordings from rat spinal
cord slices, the &amp;ldquo;entire soma isolation&amp;rdquo; method, and computer simulations. By 
comparing original recordings from an isolated soma of a dorsal horn neuron with 
simulated responses, it was shown that computer models can be adequate for the study
of somatic excitability. The modeled somata of both spinal neurons were unable to 
generate action potentials, showing only passive and local responses to current 
injections. A four- to eightfold increase in the original density of Na1 channels
was necessary to make the modeled somata of both spinal neurons excitable. In 
contrast to spinal neurons, the modeled soma of the hippocampal pyramidal neuron 
generated spikes with an overshoot of 19 mV. It is concluded that the somata of 
spinal neurons cannot generate action potentials and seem to resist their
propagation from the axon to dendrites. In contrast, the soma of the hippocampal
pyramidal neuron is able to generate spikes. It cannot initiate action potentials
in the intact neurons, but it can support their back-propagation from the axon
initial segment to dendrites.

  <description>
   The ability of the soma of a spinal dorsal horn neuron, a spinal ventral horn neuron, and a hippocampal pyramidal neuron to generate action potentials was studied using experiments and computer simulations. By comparing recordings ... of a dorsal horn neuron with simulated responses, it was shown that computer models can be adequate for the study of somatic excitability. The modeled somata of both spinal neurons were unable to generate action potentials, showing only passive and local responses to current injections. ... In contrast to spinal neurons, the modeled soma of the hippocampal pyramidal neuron generated spikes with an overshoot of +9 mV. It is concluded that the somata of spinal neurons cannot generate action potentials and seem to resist their propagation from the axon to dendrites. ... See paper for more and details.

Huang and Robinson Neurosci. 85:239 (1998) (exp.)
Benison et al., J.Theor.Biol. 210:187 (2001) (model).

Running the kinetics.hoc simulation file will show 
the activation and inactivation steady-states, the time constants, 
and a family of curves generated modeling the same protocols 
used for Figs.2C-3A of the experimental paper.
The CaL conductance has been modeled as non-inactivating.

The kinetic parameters used here are from the modeling paper.
They where chosen by the authors  
to fit the time course of the currents obtained from whole-cell 
data in their own laboratory, and are based on the results
presented in the experimental paper.

The peak conductances have been adjusted to give approximately the
same peak currents shown in the experiments.
 
Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui kinetics.hoc

Under Windows using NEURON 5.1:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
kinetics.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Questions on the model parameters should be directed to the 
authors of the modeling paper.

of Axonal NaV1.6 Sodium Channels in Action Potential Initiation of CA1
Pyramidal Neurons.

These model files were supplied by Dr Marie-Therese Horstmann.

Usage:
------

Check that you have NEURON installed (available from
http://www.neuron.yale.edu). Autolaunch from ModelDB **or** download
and extract the archive and compile the mod files to run under ...

linux/unix
----------
by typing
nrnivmodl
in the top level directory.  Then type
nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin
-------

Run mknrndll, cd to the expanded directory and press make nrnmech.dll
button.  Double click on the mosinit.hoc file.

MAC OS X
--------

Drag and drop the expanded folder onto mknrndll icon in the NEURON
application folder. Drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui
icon to start the simulation.

Once the simulation is running:
-------------------------------

Choose one of the first two buttons to either run a demo version (low
resolution) of figure 11D (left) or a publication quality run.  If you would
like you can also run a short run that finishes a 2 ms simulation
nearly instantaeously to verify that the model will run on your
platform (in this case see the oc&gt; prompt message that informs you
that the test run has completed).

In either of the first two button cases you should see an image that looks like this:

We show that the Na+ channel NaV1.6 displays a striking aggregation at the AIS
of cortical neurons.


...
In combination with simulations using a realistic
computer model of a CA1 pyramidal cell, our results imply that a hyperpolarized
voltage-dependence of activation of AIS NaV1.6 channels is important both in
determining spike threshold and localizing spike initiation to the AIS. 

...
These results suggest that NaV1.6 subunits at the AIS contribute significantly to
its role as spike trigger zone and shape repetitive discharge properties of CA1 neurons.&quot;

   The model examines dendritic NMDA-spike generation and propagation
in the dendrites of CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons. It contains
NMDA-channels in a clustered pattern on a dendrite and K-channels. The
simulation shows the whole NMDA spike and the rising phase of the
traces in separate windows.

A modeling study suggesting how a reduction in the context-dependent
input on CA1 pyramidal neurons could generate schizophrenic behavior
by M. Migliore, I. De Blasi, D. Tegolo, R. Migliore,
Neural Networks,(2011), doi:10.1016/j.neunet.2011.01.001.

With an extensive series of simulations we show how and to what extent
a pathological hypofunction of the Perforant Path input can alter the
normal recall of objects on which the neuron has been previously
tuned.

The hoc file &quot;sim_9068802-test&quot; is a typical simulation file that
illustrates the binding process. It tests all the 462 possible 5-ples
of obliques in cell 9068802 and prints to context033s1-modeldb.txt
those that, during one of the trials (seed=1), with a specific context
(0.33nA), and a specific background noise (0.4) generate a valid
somatic spike (see the paper for a definition of a valid spike).  The
results generated by 10 trials are stored in the file
&quot;c033-all-seeds.txt&quot;, which is used to calculate the average presence
of a given oblique in a valid 5-ple. 

This simulation file is for illustration purposes only. It can be
launched on a parallel system, but requires some editing to run the
full (and quite long) simulation.  Ask the authors for more info if
you want to run a full sim.

The file average.hoc reads the c033-all-seeds.txt and reproduces the
histogram corresponding to the context 0.33 nA in Fig.4 (purple bars).
In the paper, Fig.4 demonstrates that the presence of each oblique, on
average, is relatively independent from the context.

   NEURON files from the paper: A modeling study suggesting how a reduction in the context-dependent input on CA1 pyramidal neurons could generate schizophrenic behavior. by M. Migliore, I. De Blasi, D. Tegolo, R. Migliore, Neural Networks,(2011), doi:10.1016/j.neunet.2011.01.001. Starting from the experimentally supported assumption on hippocampal neurons we explore an experimentally testable prediction at the single neuron level. The model shows how and to what extent a pathological hypofunction of a contextdependent distal input on a CA1 neuron can generate hallucinations by altering the normal recall of objects on which the neuron has been previously tuned. The results suggest that a change in the context during the recall phase may cause an occasional but very significant change in the set of active dendrites used for features recognition, leading to a distorted perception of objects.Reference: Migliore M, De Blasi I, Tegolo D, Migliore R (2011) A modeling study suggesting how a reduction in the context-dependent input on CA1 pyramidal neurons could generate schizophrenic behavior.

   &lt;pre&gt;This model code will generate trajectories similar to Figure 1C.
For faster simulation (50 seconds on a 450MHz sparc ultra 10) the
&quot;Quiet&quot; checkbox is on and the trajectories will be displayed at the
end of the run. The checkbox can be turned off during the simulation
to see the them develop but the simulation will run at about 2/3 the
speed.

Frequency regulation of a slow rhythm by a fast periodic input.
J Neurosci 1998 Jul 1;18(13):5053-67

   Many nervous systems contain rhythmically active subnetworks that
interact despite oscillating at widely different frequencies.  The
stomatogastric nervous system of the crab Cancer borealis produces a
rapid pyloric rhythm and a considerably slower gastric mill rhythm.  We
construct and analyze a conductance-based compartmental model to explore
the activation of the gastric mill rhythm by the modulatory commissural
neuron 1 (MCN1)
   This model demonstrates that the period of the MCN1-activated gastric
mill rhythm, which was thought to be determined entirely by the
interaction of neurons in the gastric mill network, can be strongly
influenced by inhibitory synaptic input from the pacemaker neuron of the
fast pyloric rhythm, the anterior burster (AB) neuron.  Surprisingly,
the change of the gastric mill period produced by the pyloric input to
the gastric mill system can be many times larger than the period of the
pyloric rhythm itself.  This model illustrates several mechanisms by
which a fast oscillatory neuron may control the frequency of a much
slower oscillatory network.  These findings suggest that it is possible
to modify the slow rhythm either by direct modulation or indirectly by
modulating the faster rhythm.

Note: The NEURON version 5.1 variable step absolute tolerance has been set 
produce a simulation similar to that of the fixed step crank-nicholson
method with dt=.05(ms). For NEURON version 4.3.1, the tolerance can
be set to 0.01 .

   &lt;pre&gt;This is a conversion to NEURON of the mitral cell model described in: 

Bhalla US and Bower JM. (1993) Exploring parameter space in detailed single
neuron models: simulations of the mitral and granule cells of the olfactory bulb. 
J. Neurophysiol. 69:1948-1965. 

The original model was written in GENESIS and is available from:
http://www.bbb.caltech.edu/BABEL/babeldirs/cells/mitral_granule/

Running the model (by executing mosinit.hoc) runs a simulation comparable
to Figure 5A. The GENESIS trace is also shown for comparison. 

There are some small discrepancies between the results from the NEURON and
GENESIS versions. I believe these are due to numerical differences, but it is 
possible they are due to bugs in my code.

Description
===========

NEURON implementation of the Virtual Cell model (NE_Full_best) that
was used for the first column of results in Fig. 7 of 

An image-based model of calcium waves in differentiated neuroblastoma
cells.  Fink, C. C., B. Slepchenko, I. I. Moraru, J. Watras,
J. Schaff, and L. M. Loew.  Biophys. J. 2000 79:163-183.2000.

The Virtual Cell models described in Fink et al. 2000 are available at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://vcell.org/vcell_models/access_models/fink.html&quot;&gt;http://vcell.org/vcell_models/access_models/fink.html&lt;/a&gt; Questions about
them should be addressed to the authors of that paper.  For questions
about this NEURON implementation, contact ted dot carnevale at yale
dot edu

=====
Usage
=====

To launch a simulation, first make sure that the mod files have been
compiled (see the FAQ list at www.neuron.yale.edu for help), then
click on &quot;Init &amp; Run&quot; in the &quot;RunControl&quot; panel.

The &quot;bkr (Globals)&quot; panel controls del_bkr the time at which
bradykinin is applied and k_bkr the time constant of the
monoexponential decay of bradykinin

If you want to slow the simulation, increase &quot;Seconds per step&quot; in the
&quot;Movie Run&quot; panel to 0.1 s or more, then click on the &quot;Init &amp; Run&quot;
button in the &quot;Movie Run&quot; panel.  After the simulation finishes you
should see graphs similar to Fig. 7:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=125745&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\fink2000\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;

The &quot;shape plots&quot; and &quot;space plots&quot; show intracellular Ca and IP3
plotted along the entire length of the cell.
The time axis graphs show these variables near the &quot;distal&quot; end of the
soma and near the proximal end of the long neurite.

====================
Implementation notes
====================

There are three reasons why this implementation's simulation results
cannot be exactly identical to those shown in Fig. 7 of Fink et
al. 2000.

1.  The morphometric data for this NEURON implementation were obtained
by measurements taken from an idraw tracing of the cell image.

2.  Because of differences between the approaches used by NEURON and
Virtual Cell to represent geometry and to deal with spatial
discretization, the distribution of spatially inhomogeneous variables
in this NEURON implementation is a qualitative approximation of the
distribution specified in NE_Full_best_

3.  Unlike the Virtual Cell implementaton, the NEURON implementation 
does not specifically represent the nucleus.  Instead, the voume 
occupied by the nucleus is assumed to have the same properties as 
ordinary cytoplasm.  This has negligible effect on simulations
because the volume of the nucleus in this cell, estimated from 
figures in the paper, is probably less than (1/3.5)^3 ~ 1/40 the 
volume of the entire soma.  Fink et al., however, reduced their 
3D conceptual model to a 2D computational model in Virtual Cell 
for the sake of increased simulation speed.  But this exaggerated 
the size of the nucleus compartment--which has no SER, hence no 
Ca stores--relative to the size of the soma by a factor of about 
3.5 (i.e. the nucleus compartment became about 1/12 the size of 
the soma compartment).  On pp. 177-178, they remark that this 
depressed the somatic Ca signal in their simulations.

Finally, there is also a cosmetic difference: this implementation uses
a &quot;thermal&quot; color map rather than the &quot;rainbow&quot; color map used in the
paper.

---------------
Parameter names
---------------

The Virtual Cell and NEURON implementations of the model described in
Fink et al. 2000 use different names for many of the variables and
parameters described in the paper.  Below is a list of the names from
Tables 2-4 of Fink et al. 2000, with the corresponding names from the
Virtual Cell (NE_Full_best) and NEURON implementations.

Comments:

1.  Tables 2-4 make full use of subscripts and the occasional greek
letter.  In column 1 of the following table, subscripts are indicated
by underscores _ (J&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is shown as J_0), and greek letters
are spelled out (e.g. gamma).

2.  The NEURON implementation used this naming strategy:
  a.  try to stay close to the names used in the paper
  b.  avoid the underscore _ character
  c.  use lower case for STATE and ASSIGNED variables

  d.  avoid conflicts between user-assigned and
      automatically-generated names (e.g. for each STATE foo on the
      LHS of an ODE or reaction, there is an automatically-generated
      derivative variable called Dfoo)

3.  The parameter values and units shown here are those used in the
NEURON implementation.  They are taken from NE_Full_best, and scale
factors have been applied as needed for units consistency.

Brent Sheasby's comments:

I've provided the *.hoc and geometry file of each model retinal ganglion
cells used in Sheasby, B.W. and Fohlmeister, J.F. 1999, where each
sub-directory represents 1 neuron.  They are divided into the directories
based on their morphological categories determined by Toris and Miller, 1995
(Large, Medium Complex, Small Simple, etc.). I have compressed them into 1
Winzip file (sheasbyfohlmeister1999.zip).  When uncompressing the files,
please use the option that preserves the directory structures.  ...

I did supply an additional speadsheet which provides both classification's 
(Toris and Miller,1995, and our new electrophysiological classification 
groups 1 - 4) neuron's active and passive properties. Each figure does 
provide the type of cell that was used, e.g. the &quot;group 2,medium complex&quot; 
cell in Fig. 6. Therefore, the spreadsheet may help narrow the search for the 
exact neuron used in the figure.

The present directory contains all the files needed to run the simulations
using the Interviews version of NEURON.  These files are commented and should
run straighforwardly, provided the NEURON simulator is installed properly.

The kinetic synapse mechanism

-----------------------------
This mechanisms has the following properties:

1. It is based on a simple kinetic scheme of binding of transmitter on
   postsynaptic receptors.  This description has the advantage that
   it is fully compatible with the level of description used for other
   mechanisms (Hodgkin-Huxley currents, calcium diffusion, etc).

2. The mechanism gives EPSP's or IPSP's from a pulse of transmitter.
   The waveform of these PSP's is very close to EPSP's or IPSP's measured
   experimentally, and the decay is monoexponential.  The user can set all
   the parameters corresponding to the rising phase, decay, amplitude, etc...
   (see .mod files)

3. Summation of consecutive PSP's is handled automatically by the 
   mechanism without need for an explicit event cue.  

4. Each synapse has a state variable corresponding to the fraction of 
   postsynaptic receptors in the open state.  However, the kinetics are
   first order, and so can be solved exactly.  This has the important
   advantage that it can be fit very easily to experimental recordings
   (see J. Computational Neurosci. paper).

5. Finally, this mechanism is very fast to compute. It does not require 
   solving any differential equations; at any given time only one exponential
   is calculated per synapse.  Thus, the mechanism is as fast to compute as 
   optimized versions of alpha function-based models.



How to run the simulation
-------------------------

This directory contains the files necessary to run a simulation of each
type of receptor mentioned above.  The parameters have been obtained
by fitting the model to whole-cell recordings of the various types of
synaptic response (see individual .oc and .mod files for details).

To compile the demo, NEURON and INTERVIEWS must be installed and working on
the machine you are using.  Just type &quot;nrnivmodl&quot; to compile the mechanisms
given in the mod files (glutamate.mod and gaba.mod are the mechanisms
for glutamate and gaba synapses, and HH.mod is the Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics). 

Then, execute one of the four example files by typing:

nrngui &amp;lt;ocfile&amp;gt;

where &amp;lt;ocfile&amp;gt; stands for either:

 	demo_ampa.oc	: AMPA/Kainate glutamatergic receptors
	demo_nmda.oc	: NMDA glutamatergic receptors
	demo_gabaa.oc	: GABA-A receptors
	demo_gabab.oc	: GABA-B receptors

Once the menu and graphics interface has appeared, click on &quot;Init and Run&quot;
button to start the simulation...



All these simulations were done using the NEURON simulator written by
Michael Hines, and which is available freely on internet via anonymous
ftp from neuron.neuro.duke.edu:/neuron.  For more information about how
to get NEURON and how to install it, please refer to the following sites:

   &lt;pre&gt;Simulations that illustrate the firing pattern of a simulated dopamine
neuron in vitro and in vivo. These simulations are related to the
following paper:

Canavier C.C. and Landry R.S. (2006) An increase in AMPA and a
decrease in SK conductance increase burst firing by different
mechanisms in a model of a dopamine neuron in vivo. J Neurophysiol
96(5):2549-63.

  
Example In Vivo Simulations 

------------------------------------- 

In these simulations, the file Receptor.cpp generates a random set of
Poisson-distributed events, and convolves the resultant pulse train
with the explicit solution to a differential equation that is a rising
exponential for the one ms that transmitter is postulated to reside in
the synaptic cleft, and a falling exponential thereafter. The
resultant .dat files are provided with each simulation. For example,
the files fig4bAMPA.dat and fig4bNMDA.dat drive the AMPA conductance
and NMDA permeability respectively for Fig.4B.

Note that the compiled mechanisms are different for nmda and ampa than
in the in vitro case because they are no longer constant, but rather
driven by the input files described above. You can run the simulation
either by auto-launching from ModelDB, or by first compiling the
mechanisms as follows:

Under linux: ---

nrnivmodl

Then type 

nrngui mosinit.hoc

Under Windows: ---

Run mknrndll twice to compile the mod files in the top level directory
and then in the in_vitro directory.  Then double click on the
mosinit.hoc file to start the in vivo simulations or on the fig4a.hoc
to start the in vitro simulations.

Under MAC - OS X: ---

Drag and drop the archive file on the mknrndll icon (in the NEURON
application folder).  Drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the
nrngui icon.

---
Now that you have started the model on your platform:
Select a figure from the buttons and then press Init &amp; Run.

Alternatively, if desired you can run the figures directly by running
commands under linux (with your path set appropriately):

special fig4b1.hoc - 

Once the menu and graphics interface has appeared, click on the &quot;Init
and run&quot; button to start the simulation.

Follow the same instructions for the rest of the in vivo files:
fig4b2.hoc, fig4b3.hoc, fig5a.hoc, fig5b.hoc, fig9a1.hoc - fig9a3.hoc,
fig9b1.hoc - fig9b3, fig10a.hoc - fig10c.hoc, fig11b1.hoc, and
fig11b2.hoc.

Note: two flags in the hoc files may be useful to the experienced
user.  restart = 1 restarts from the initial conditions, whereas
restart = 0 does not, back = 0 uses the GUI, whereas back = 1 sends
the output to stdout.


Example In Vitro Simulation

------------------------------------- 

These files simulates the bath application of glutamate in a slice
preparation such that the synaptic conductances reflect a constant,
average level of activation

You can run the simulation by first compiling the mechanisms as
follows:

In linux: ---

cd in_vitro
nrnivmodl
nrngui fig4a.hoc

In windows: ---

Use mknrndll, change to the in_vitro, and make the nrnmech.dll there.
Double click the fig4a.hoc file.

In MAC - OS X: ---

Drag and drop the in_vitro folder onto the mknrndll icon in the NEURON
application folder.  Drag and drop the fig4a.hoc file onto the nrngui
icon.

---
Now that the in vitro model is running:

Select a figure from the radio buttons.  Once the menu and graphics
interface has appeared, click on the &quot;Init and run&quot; button to start
the simulation.

  <description>
   &quot;A stylized, symmetric, compartmental model of a dopamine neuron in vivo shows how rate and pattern can be modulated either concurrently or differentially. If two or more parameters in the model are varied concurrently, the baseline firing rate and the extent of bursting become decorrelated, which provides an explanation for the lack of a tight correlation in vivo and is consistent with some independence of the mechanisms that generate baseline firing rates versus bursting. ...&quot; See paper for more and details.

This compartmental model of a hippocampal granule cell has spinous synapses
placed on the second-order dendrites.  Changes in shape and connectivity of
the spines usually does not effect the synaptic response of the cell unless
active conductances are incorporated into the spine membrane (e.g. voltage-dependent
Ca2+ channels).  With active conductances, spines can generate spike-like events.
We showed that changes like fusion and branching, or in fact any increase in the 
equivalent spine neck resistance, could trigger a dramatic increase in the spine's
influence on the dendritic shaft potential.
 

After auto-launching the model, run the parameter set desired from the control
box.

The mosinit.hoc file constructs a graphical interface for
simulation of the curves from Fig 3a.

The model supports the hypothesis that the kinetics of NMDA receptors (for
two different subunit compositions) delay the binding of glutamate so that
at the time scale of synaptic events less glutamate is bound than would be 
at the constant (equilibrium) glutamate concentration reported in the
literature.  See above paper for more details and references.

For more information on the model please contact Dr Tim Murphy.
email address: thmurphy@interchange.ubc.ca

These model files (except mosinit.hoc) were supplied by Dr. Tim H. Murphy
A non-substantive change to IVndma5.mod (avoid &quot;exit&quot; call in favor of
&quot;hoc_execerror&quot; in IVnmda5.mod) by Michael Hines allows the model to be
run under mswin.

Some comments from Dr. Murphy's with respect to the model files:
... As we mentioned in the paper we adapted code previously
written by others Mainen, Destexhe to produce the models, we did derive
parameters specific for NR2A and NR2B and adjusted the rate const for 37 C
as well as making exponential and ramping release models..
  The files with temp in the name are at 37 C (rate const adjusted)
  The hoc files with IV in the name are dose response curves.
  The one with ex in the title means exponential rise and fall of transmitter.
  Ramp means ramping up and down of transmitter level.

Notes about the figures:

Fig. 3A:

A simplified compartmental model that encompasses the fundamental
morphological features of a layer 5 pyramidal neuron. In the model,
the first 50 um of the axonal length are assumed to be uncovered by
the myelin sheath and to possess a uniform Na+ channel density about
threefold higher than that of the soma.  The subsequent, myelinated
segment possesses no Na+ channels.  In addition to Hodgkin-Huxley type
Na+ and K+ conductances, the model incorporates longitudinal diffusion
of Na+ ions between neighboring compartments with a diffusion
coefficient of 0.6 um2 ms; no mechanism for Na+ extrusion is
included. Thus, the spatio-temporal patterns of the simulated [Na+]i
transients solely reflects transmembrane influx into the 'active'
compartments that possess Na+ channels (soma and AIS) and Na+
diffusion into compartments that either possess no Na+ channels
(myelinated segments) or are large sinks because they have a
relatively small surface-to-volume ratio (soma).  The model closely
mimicks experimentally observed changes in SBFI fluorescence during a
single action potential.

Fig. 4B 10 APs and 100 APs 

Na+ transients in models with different process-to-soma ratios of Na+
channel density. When Na+ channel density in the process is set equal
to that in the soma (default value, 250 pS/um2), during the AP trains
[Na+]i in the process rises more significantly because of its higher
surface-to-volume ratio.  If we will keep somatic Na+ channel density
constant and vary Na+ channel density in the process (AIS hh_Cs_scaled
in Biophysics menu of the CellBuilder), we can find out that the basal
dendrite Na+ channel density has to be 0.1-0.3-fold larger than the
somatic density and the AIS density has to be one- to threefold larger
than the somatic density to match the experimentally determined
signals.

Fig. 6B

Simulated changes in [Na+]i elicited by a single action potential
plotted against distance from the axon hillock.  Because the nodes are
small, Na+ ions diffuse laterally almost as quickly as they enter
across the nodal membrane.  Simulation shows that diffusion-mediated
[Na+]i equilibration between the nodal and internodal volumes should
be nearly complete in milliseconds and that more than 90% of Na+ ions
that enter a 1-um-long node were already in the internodal region
within 10 ms of the peak of the action potential. In contrast, 10 ms
after an action potential in the 48-um-long AIS, dissipation of the
Na+ gradient was minimal. Default values for Na+ channel desnsity: AIS
gnabar_hh_Cs_scaled = 800 pS/um2, node gnabar_hh_Cs_scaled = 1200
pS/um2.  The latter value could be changed to 1600 pS/um2 and to 8000
pS/um2 to obtain the model of panel C, right.

  <description>
   &quot;In cortical pyramidal neurons, the axon initial segment (AIS) is pivotal in synaptic integration.

It has been asserted that this is because there is a high density of Na+ channels in the AIS. 

However, we found that action potential&amp;ndash;associated Na+ flux, as measured by high-speed fluorescence Na+ imaging, was about threefold larger in the rat AIS than in the soma. 

Spike-evoked Na+ flux in the AIS and the first node of Ranvier was similar and was eightfold lower in basal dendrites.

...
In computer simulations, these data were consistent with the known features of action potential generation in these neurons.&quot;Reference: Fleidervish IA, Lasser-Ross N, Gutnick MJ, Ross WN (2010) Na+ imaging reveals little difference in action potential-evoked Na+ influx between axon and soma.  13:852-60

   &lt;pre&gt;This is a conductance-based model of a rod photoreceptor cell based on
other modeling works

(Barnes et al,1989 and Publio et al,2006 and Kourennyi and Liu et al,2004 ).

 In this model four types of ionic channels identified in the inner
segment of the rod: nonselective cation channel (h), delayed
rectifying potassium channel (Kv), noninactivating potassium channel
(Kx) and calcium channel (Ca) was used.

The model accurately reproduces the rod response when stimulated with a
simulated photocurrent signal.

We can show the effect of nonselective cation channel .The absence of
this channel cause increasing the peak amplitude and the time to reach
the peak of voltage response and absence of transient mode in this
response.

Simply auto-launch from ModelDB or 

1) download archive and expand the zip file,
2) compile the mod files with mknrndll (mswin) or nrnivmodl
(unix/linux), and
3) start the program by double clicking the ROD.hoc file (mswin), or

The simulation files control.hoc and after-withdrawal.hoc generate the
first 4 sec of the simulations in Fig. 7b top and bottom of the paper,
respectively.  They reproduce the simulations shown in the
supplementary movie.  In the figure is plotted the range 5&amp;lt;t&amp;lt;10
sec from 15 sec long simulations.

Questions on how to use this model should be directed to
michele.migliore@pa.ibf.cnr.it

Example Usage:

Auto-launch from ModelDB or download and extract the archive, compile
the mod files and start with either double clicking the mosinit.hoc
file (windows), drag and dropping the mosinit.hoc file on the nrngui
icon (mac OS X), or typing &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot; on the command line
(linux/unix).

Once the simulation is started pressing the &quot;control&quot; button should
result in the following graph similar to figure Fig. 7b top:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=126640&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\withdrawal\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

   Cannabinoid withdrawal produces a hypofunction of dopaminergic neurons targeting medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the forebrain. Administration of a CB1 receptor antagonist to control rats provoked structural abnormalities, reminiscent of those observed in withdrawal conditions and support the regulatory role of cannabinoids in neurogenesis, axonal growth and synaptogenesis. Experimental observations were incorporated into a realistic computational model which predicts a strong reduction in the excitability of morphologically-altered MSN, yielding a significant reduction in action potential output. These paper provided direct morphological evidence for functional abnormalities associated with cannabinoid dependence at the level of dopaminergic neurons and their post synaptic counterpart, supporting a hypodopaminergic state as a distinctive feature of the &amp;ldquo;addicted brain&amp;rdquo;.Reference: Spiga S, Lintas A, Migliore M, Diana M (2010) Altered architecture and functional consequences of the mesolimbic dopamine system

Excerpt from abstract:

1. We have developed a compartmental model of a turtle cerebellar granule 
cell consisting of 13 compartments that represent the soma and 4 
dendrites. We used this model to investigate the synaptic integration of 
mossy fiber inputs in granule cells. 
2. The somatic compartment contained six active ionic conductances: 
a sodium conductance with fast activation and inactivation kinetics, 
gNa; a high-voltage-activated calcium conductance, gCa(HVA); a 
delayed potassium conductance, gK(DR); a transient potassium 
conductance, gK(A); a slowly relaxing mixed Na+/K+ conductance 
activating at hyperpolarized membrane potentials, gH, and a 
calcium- and voltage-dependent potassium conductance, gK(Ca). The 
kinetics of these conductances was derived from electrophysiological 
studies in a variety of preparations, including turtle and rat granule 
cells. 
3. In the soma, dynamics of intracellular free Ca2+ was modeled 
by incorporation of a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, radial diffusion, and binding 
sites for Ca2+. 
4. The model of the turtle granule cell exhibited depolarization-induced
action potential firing with properties closely resembling those seen 
with intracellular recordings in turtle granule cells in vitro.

Summary:

It is well known that interneurons are heterogeneous in their morphologies, biophysical 
properties, pharmacological sensitivities and electrophysiological responses, but it is 
unknown how best to understand this diversity. Given their critical roles in shaping brain 
output, it is important to try to understand the functionality of their computational 
characteristics. To do this, we focus on specific interneuron subtypes. In particular, it 
has recently been shown that long-term potentiation is induced specifically on 
oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (O-LM) interneurons in hippocampus CA1 and that the same cells 
contain the highest density of dendritic sodium and potassium conductances measured to date. 
We create multi-compartment models of an O-LM hippocampal interneuron using passive 
properties, channel kinetics, densities and distributions specific to this cell type, and 
explore its signaling characteristics. We find that spike initiation depends on both 
location and amount of input, as well as the intrinsic properties of the interneuron. Distal
 synaptic input always produces strong back-propagating spikes whereas proximal input could 
produce both forward and back-propagating spikes depending on the input strength. We 
speculate that the highly active dendrites of these interneurons endow them with a 
specialized function within the hippocampal circuitry by allowing them to regulate direct 
and indirect signaling pathways within the hippocampus.

This is the readme for a model recreated from the publication: 

Baker MD (2005) Protein kinase C mediates up-regulation of
tetrodotoxin-resistant, persistent Na+ current in rat and mouse
sensory neurones. J Physiol 567:851-67

Astract:

The tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-r) persistent Na+ current, attributed
to NaV1.9, was recorded in small (&lt;25 um apparent diameter) dorsal
root ganglion (DRG) neurones cultured from P21 rats and from adult
wild-type and NaV1.8 null mice. In conventional whole-cell recordings
intracellular GTP-gamma-S caused current up-regulation, an effect
inhibited by the PKC pseudosubstrate inhibitor, PKC19-36. The current
amplitude was also up-regulated by 25 uM intracellular
1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) consistent with PKC
involvement. In perforated-patch recordings, phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate (PMA) up-regulated the current, whereasmembrane-permeant
activators of protein kinaseA (PKA) werewithout effect.PGE2 did not
acutely up-regulate the current. Conversely, both PGE2 and PKA
activation up-regulated the major TTX-r Na+ current,
NaV1.8. Extracellular ATP up-regulated the persistent current with an
average apparent Kd near 13 uM, possibly consistent with P2Y receptor
activation.  Numerical simulation of the up-regulation qualitatively
reproduced changes in sensory neurone firing properties. The
activation of PKC appears to be a necessary step in the GTP-dependent
up-regulation of persistent Na+ current.

The mosinit.hoc file generates traces similar to figure 2 in the paper.
It takes about 5 minutes to generate this figure on a 800 MHz Win 2000 PC.

The model adopted De Schutter and Bower's model as the starting point, 
then modified the descriptions of several ion channels, such as the P-type 
Ca channel and the delayed rectifier K channel, and added class-E Ca 
channels and D-type K channels to the model. Our new model reproduces most
of our experimental results and supports the conclusions of our 
experimental study that class-E Ca channels and D-type K channels are 
present and functioning in the dendrites of Purkinje neurons.
See above paper for more details and references.

M. Migliore, L. Messineo, M. Ferrante
Dendritic Ih selectively blocks temporal summation of 
unsynchronized distal inputs in CA1 pyramidal neurons, 
J.Comput. Neurosci. 16:5-13 (2004).

The model demonstrates how the dendritic Ih in pyramidal neurons 
could selectively suppress AP generation for a volley of excitatory afferents 
when they are asynchronously and distally activated.
See the paper for more details.

Since most of the results in the paper were obtained by
averaging the results from many (100) simulations,
rather than reproduce all the simulations from one figure,
here we have chosen to show a typical simulation
to illustrate the main prediction of the paper.

The synchro-n128.hoc file will run four 200ms simulations 
plotting the membrane potential at the soma
and a ShapePlot to show the local depolarization during each simulation.

15 identical AMPA synapses were used,
randomly distributed in the apical compartments at 0-50um or 250-300um
from the soma with or without I-h. Colored labels in the plot
indicate the various cases (proximal or distal stimulation, with or
without Ih).
The peak conductance has been chosen in such a way 
to obtain approximately the same somatic depolarization in the 
absence of I-h. To better compare the results for each case,
in each simulation the synapses were activated in the same 
(asynchronous) order. 

The simulations illustrate the typical result that without Ih 
an AP is elicited following an asynchronous stimulation
in both proximal or distal dendrites (white and blue traces), whereas
in the presence of Ih (red and green traces) an AP is elicited 
only for a proximal stimulation. Instead, a synchronous activation of the input
would generate an AP in all cases.  

The simulations are best appreciated using a black background for the graphs.
To invert the background/foreground color edit
the lib/nrn.def (windows) or share/nrn/lib/nrn.defaults (unix) file 
in the NEURON home directory, and change the two lines
 
*Scene_background: #ffffff   
*Scene_foreground: #000000   
 
to 

*Scene_background: #000000   
*Scene_foreground: #ffffff   

This change will affect all future graphs, so
do not forget to reset the values to their original values
if you do not like graphs with a black background and white lines.

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui synchro-n128.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
synchro-n128.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

 Simulation code from Durstewitz &amp; Gabriel (2006), &quot;Dynamical basis of 
 irregular spiking in NMDA-driven prefrontal cortex neurons&quot;, Cerebral
 Cortex
***********************************************************************

This archive should contain all files needed to run the network and 
single neuron simulations from the paper above. For single neurons, 
both NEURON and MatLab-based code is provided (for both runSglPCwcNMDA.m
is the ML-wrapper).

Please note that many network parameters are initialized according to 
random distributions (with given mean &amp; stdv). Precise parameter 
configurations could therefore depend on the way the random number 
generator is implemented and initialized (and on processor type).
The paramter configuration on which the simulations in the paper were 
based is provided here in the file 'NetPar0.par'.

The simulation files expect a directory called 'out' in the current path.

Note from the ModelDB administrator:
The network model run after the mod files are compiled
nrngui runThis.hoc
takes about 4 hours to complete and writes about 1.2GB of the 125 cells
voltage traces into the out directory.

The model files are also available at the author's web site:

http://www.pion.ac.uk/~daniel/

A network demo runs the network for a short time to
verify that the code is compatible with your version of neuron:
nrngui mosinit.hoc
and then select the network demo run.

The model has been verified to run on linux, mac os x, and ms win.

On the mac drag the DynBasIrregSpNMDA folder to the mknrndll icon
in the NEURON folder.  Then drag the mosinit.hoc file to nrngui to
start the simulation.

In unix, ms win compile the mod file using mknrndll, then start the
simulation by running nrngui mosinit.hoc (unix) or double clicking on
the mosinit.hoc file (ms win).

  <description>
   Slow N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) synaptic currents are assumed to strongly contribute to the persistently elevated firing rates observed in prefrontal cortex (PFC) during working memory. During persistent activity, spiking of many neurons is highly irregular. ... The highest interspike-interval (ISI) variability occurred in a transition regime where the subthreshold membrane potential distribution shifts from mono- to bimodality, ... Predictability within irregular ISI series was significantly higher than expected from a noise-driven linear process, indicating that it might best be described through complex (potentially chaotic) nonlinear deterministic processes. Accordingly, the phenomena observed in vitro could be reproduced in purely deterministic biophysical model neurons. High spiking irregularity in these models emerged within a chaotic, close-to-bifurcation regime characterized by a shift of the membrane potential distribution from mono- to bimodality and by similar ISI return maps as observed in vitro. ... NMDA-induced irregular dynamics may have important implications for computational processes during working memory and neural coding.Reference: Durstewitz D, Gabriel T (2006) Dynamical Basis of Irregular Spiking in NMDA-Driven Prefrontal Cortex Neurons  17:894-908

NOTE:
Simulation replicated directly from M. Bazhenov's C++ file.

Cortical SU cells are getting too little stimulation; I was unable to find the
parameter discrepancy that accounted for this.

This simulation takes a couple of minutes to run on a 800 MHz Pentium III mswin pc.

  <description>
   In the cortical model, augmenting responses were more powerful in the &quot;input&quot; layer compared with those in the &quot;output&quot; layer. Cortical stimulation of the network model produced augmenting responses in cortical neurons in distant cortical areas through corticothalamocortical loops and low-threshold intrathalamic augmentation. ... The predictions of the model were compared with in vivo recordings from neurons in cortical area 4 and thalamic ventrolateral nucleus of anesthetized cats. The known intrinsic properties of thalamic cells and thalamocortical interconnections can account for the basic properties of cortical augmenting responses.  See reference for details.  NEURON implementation note: cortical SU cells are getting slightly too little stimulation -  reason unknown.Reference: Bazhenov M, Timofeev I, Steriade M, Sejnowski TJ (1998) Computational models of thalamocortical augmenting responses.  18:6444-65

NEURON mod files from the paper:

M. Migliore, C. Cannia, CC Canavier, A modeling study suggesting a
possible pharmacological target to mitigate the effects of ethanol on
reward-related dopaminergic signaling, J. Neurophysiol., in press
(2008).

We use a realistic computational model of dopaminergic neurons in vivo
to suggest that ethanol, through its effects on Ih, modifies the
temporal structure of the spiking activity. The model predicts that
the dopamine level may increase much more during bursting than
pacemaking activity, especially in those brain regions with a slow
dopamine clearance rate.  The results suggest that a selective
pharmacological remedy could thus be devised against the rewarding
effects of ethanol that are postulated to mediate alcohol abuse and
addiction, targeting the specific HCN genes expressed in dopaminergic
neurons.

Usage:

The file fig3.hoc reproduces the results shown in Fig.3 of the paper.

To start the simulation:

---
Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui fig3.hoc

---
Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
fig3.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

---
Under MAC OS X:

Drag and drop the extracted folder onto the mknrndll icon. Drag and
drop the mosinit.hoc onto the nrngui icon.
---
Once the simulation is running:

Each simulation (control, 50mM, 100mM) takes about 800sec of real time
and can be started by pressing the button so labeled.  After they are
run you should have a graph that looks like:

Effects of characteristic dendritic tip geometry on the electrical

J Neurophysiol 2001 May;85(5):2289-92

Running the mosinit.hoc program with Neuron recreates Fig 2A.
The fig2A.ses file can also be run by itself with Neuron.

The abstract from the paper:

 Of the factors that characterize the properties and functions of 
 neurons, dendritic geometry is one of the most critical. We used 
 simulations employing the multi-compartment model to study the 
 effects of dendritic tip geometry on the electrical properties of 
 the &quot;large cell&quot; in a teleost thalamic nucleus from the corpus 
 glomerulosum. We demonstrated a dramatic geometrical &quot;boosting&quot; 
 effect; passive propagation of the synaptic inputs from the 
 dendritic tip to the soma through the dendritic stalk is less 
 attenuated in cells with larger tips.

mkdir modeldb

&quot;sh modelfix.sh&quot; downloads the three single neuron models used in
the paper, extracts them into subdirectories of modeldb and
trivially modifies some files so the models can be launched without
automatically running a simulation.

&quot;sh perfrun.sh&quot; generates the data for figure 5.

   &lt;pre&gt;NEURON mod files from the paper:
Maciej T. Lazarewicz, Michele Migliore, Giorgio A. Ascoli (2002)
A new bursting model of CA3 pyramidal cell physiology suggests multiple 
locations for spike initiation, Biosystems, 67:129-137.

The model shows how using a CA1-like distribution of active
dendritic conductances in a CA3 morphology results in 
dendritic initiation of spikes during a burst. 
The effect is demonstrated here in a demo
simulation reproducing the results in Fig.2 of the paper.
The ca3_paper.hoc simulation will show the membrane potential at the soma,
the time course of membrane potential with distance from soma 
for three different paths spanning the entire neuron lenght,
and a movie of the neuron depolarization (a NEURON Shape Plot)
during a burst elicited by a short (1nA, 5ms) somatic current pulse.

The simulation is best appreciated using a black background for the graphs.
To invert the background/foreground color edit
the lib/nrn.def (windows) or share/nrn/lib/nrn.defaults (unix) file 
in the NEURON home directory, and change the two lines
 
*Scene_background: #ffffff   
*Scene_foreground: #000000   
 
to 

*Scene_background: #000000   
*Scene_foreground: #ffffff   

This change will affect all future graphs, so
do not forget to reset the values to their original values
if you do not like graphs with a black background and white lines.

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation with the command 
nrngui ca3_paper.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
ca3_paper.hoc 
will run the simulation.

Questions on how to use this model with NEURON should be directed to 
Maciej Lazarewicz (mailto:mlazarew@seas.upenn.edu) 

Questions on how to use the mod files should be directed to
Michele Migliore (michele.migliore@pa.ibf.cnr.it).

   &lt;pre&gt;NEURON model files from the paper 
M. Migliore, L. Messineo, M. Cardaci, G.F. Ayala, 
Quantitative modeling of perception and production of time intervals,
J.Neurophysiol. 86, 2754-2760 (2001). 

Using a basic biophysical model of a timekeeping system, 
and experimental data on time intervals produced or estimated under 
different conditions, the paper shows that experimental values, variability, and distributions, 
can be quantitatively explained in terms of a background synaptic activity such 
as that generated by attention. The paper suggests a possible
link between behavioral data and neural mechanisms at the single neuron level.

The mod files include a POINT_PROCESS that generates synaptic pulses
according to a Poissonian distribution, modified in such a way that its mean ISI 
could be drawn from a normal distribution. 
We used this mechanism to model intervals produced or estimated by different subjects,
whereas different cognitive loads were modeled by the strength of inhibition.
See the paper for more details on the underlying assumptions.

Under unix systems:
compile the mod files using the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui timing_db.hoc

This will open a window from which a simulation of 5 subjects producing a 0.5 sec interval
can be run. Change &quot;inhibition&quot; to model different experimental conditions and cognitive loads.

Under Windows:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll DOS box&quot; and 
follow on-screen instructions.
A double click on the simulation file
timing_db.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

===============================================

BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE CONTENTS


Three different but related models are involved in this package:

1). A realistic model of Layer 5 pyramidal cell with sophisticatedly
described voltage-dependent sodium channels at the axon initial
segment. Either action potential's initiation site (figure not shown
in the aforementioned paper, see its main text) or backpropagation
failure threshold (Supplementary Fig.4 and Fig.8) can be tested
here. This section produced Fig.5d and 5e.

2). A model of &quot;uniform axon&quot; for addressing the relative contribution
of Nav1.6 and Nav1.2 in action potential's initiation. This produced
Fig.5b and 5c.

3). A single-compartment model for examining the activation and
inactivation properties of these two channel subtypes. This produced
Supplementary Fig.3.

All above are accessible through running &quot;init.hoc&quot;. 

See &quot;Overview.png&quot; for detailed organization of files.

Note: The names &quot;naaxon&quot; and &quot;nasoma&quot; appeared in Online Methods have
been replaced by &quot;na16&quot; and &quot;na12&quot; here in this model for
clarity. They stand for low- and high-threshold Nav channels at the
axon initial segment, respectively, whereas those located in
somatodendritic region are termed &quot;na&quot;, without any suffix.

===============================================

USAGE

1. If needed, generate your own nrnmech.dll with *.mod files in the
directory MECHANISM, and replace any old dll files with the new one.

2. &quot;init.hoc&quot; can be directly executed from Neuron.exe.  (double click
if Neuron has been installed in your computer)

3. For a better experience of editing and debugging, it is strongly
recommended to use the open source software PSPad editor to open the
project file &quot;PSPad_Project.ppr&quot;.  (see
http://www.neuron.yale.edu/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t;=1219)

   &quot;...Previous computational studies have yielded conflicting conclusions
about the role of Na+ channel density and biophysical properties in
action potential initiation as a result of inconsistent estimates of
channel density. Our modeling studies integrated the immunostaining
and electrophysiological results and showed that the lowest
threshold for action potential initiation at the distal AIS was largely
determined by the density of low-threshold Nav1.6 channels ... Distinct from the function of Nav1.6 channel, the Nav1.2 channel
may control action potential backpropagation because of its high
density at the proximal AIS and high threshold. ... In conclusion, distal AIS accumulation of Nav1.6 channels determines
the low threshold for action potential initiation; whereas
proximal AIS accumulation of Nav1.2 channels sets the threshold for
the generation of somatodendritic potentials and ensures action
potential backpropagation to the soma and dendrites. Thus, Nav1.6
and Nav1.2 channels serve distinct functions in action potential
initiation and backpropagation.&quot;Reference: Hu W, Tian C, Li T, Yang M, Hou H, Shu Y (2009) Distinct contributions of Na(v)1.6 and Na(v)1.2 in action potential initiation and backpropagation. Nat Neurosci 12:996-1002

This is the readme for the NEURON model from the paper:
 
Ferrante et al, Feed-forward inhibition as a buffer of the neuronal
input-output relation.  Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. (2009)
 
In this paper, the model shows that feed-forward inhibition (FFI) can
change a steeply sigmoid I/O curve into a double-sigmoid typical of
buffer systems.  Specifically Fig_1B_left.hoc and Fig_1B_left.hoc
respectively produce plots of firing response of the model MOPP cell
(left) and granule cell (right) upon somatic current injections.
 
Under linux/unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui Fig_1B_left.hoc
 
Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
Fig_1B_left.hoc 
will open the simulation window.
 
Under MAC OS X:
to compile the mod files drag and drop the extracted folder onto the
mknrndll icon. Drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui
icon.
 
Once NEURON started you can set a current amplitude in the graph
textbox, press the button &quot;init &amp; run&quot; and check the corresponding
output firing rate (Hz).



When the simulations for the two cells are done the results should
look similar to these:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=124291&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\FFI\.\screenshot.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

You can try another current amplitude and reiterate the process to
build an I-f curve (see paper for details).

These files reproduce the model associated with the following paper:

Aradi I, Holmes WR. Role of multiple calcium and calcium-dependent
conductances in regulation of hippocampal dentate granule cell
excitability. J Comput Neurosci. 1999 May-Jun;6(3):215-35.

We have constructed a detailed model of a hippocampal dentate granule
(DG) cell that includes nine different channel types. Channel
densities and distributions were chosen to reproduce reported
physiological responses observed in normal solution and when blockers
were applied. The model was used to explore the contribution of each
channel type to spiking behavior with particular emphasis on the
mechanisms underlying postspike events. T-type calcium current in more
distal dendrites contributed prominently to the appearance of the
depolarizing after-potential, and its effect was controlled by
activation of BK-type calcium-dependent potassium
channels. Coactivation and interaction of N-, and/or L-type calcium
and AHP currents present in somatic and proximal dendritic regions
contributed to the adaptive properties of the model DG cell in
response to long-lasting current injection. The model was used to
predict changes in channel densities that could lead to epileptogenic
burst discharges and to predict the effect of altered buffering
capacity on firing behavior. We conclude that the clustered spatial
distributions of calcium related channels, the presence of slow
delayed rectifier potassium currents in dendrites, and calcium
buffering properties, together, might explain the resistance of DG
cells to the development of epileptogenic burst discharges.

Usage:

will open the simulation window.

Under MAC OS X:

Drag and drop the plast folder onto the mknrndll icon in the NEURON
application folder.  When the mod files are finished compiling drag
and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.
---
Some typographical errors have been corrected in this implementation:

-The Na and KDR parameters in the paper were chosen relative to a
 resting potential of 0 mV; we have adjusted them to correspond to a
 resting potential of -70 mV.

-In the equation for alpha_c (N-type calcium current), 19.98 has been
 replaced by 19.88.

-The intracellular calcium concentration in the equations for the SK
 current is given not in uM but in mM.

  <description>
   We have constructed a detailed model of a hippocampal dentate granule (DG) cell that includes nine different channel types. 
Channel densities and distributions were chosen to reproduce reported physiological responses observed in normal solution and when blockers were applied. 

The model was used to explore the contribution of each channel type to spiking behavior with particular emphasis on the mechanisms underlying postspike events. 

...
The model was used to predict changes in channel densities that could lead to epileptogenic burst discharges and to predict the effect of altered buffering capacity on firing behavior. 

We conclude that the clustered spatial distributions of calcium related channels, the presence of slow delayed rectifier potassium currents in dendrites, and calcium buffering properties, together, might explain the resistance of DG cells to the development of epileptogenic burst discharges.Reference: Aradi I, Holmes WR (1999) Role of multiple calcium and calcium-dependent conductances in regulation of hippocampal dentate granule cell excitability.  6:215-35

Voltage-gated K+ channels in layer 5 neocortical pyramidal neurones from young rats: subtypes and gradients
A. Korngreen and B. Sakmann, J.Physiol. 525.3, 621-639 (2000).

The kinetics.hoc file reproduces Fig.4 and Fig.7 of the paper
using the kinetic parameters as calculated by the authors using
a pharmacological separation of the currents. 
The activation and deactivation currents were simulated
using the voltage clamp values and protocols indicated
in Fig.4B and 7B with a -21mV reversal potential, because of
the 65mM K+ concentration used in the bath.

The parameter C2 on the caption of fig.7 
for the deactivation time constant of the slow current
should be 175.03 instead of 1.15.

The peak conductances have been arbitrary set to values
giving approximately the same current in the simulations
of Figs.4B and 7B.

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui kinetics.hoc

Under Windows using NEURON 5.1:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file

   &lt;pre&gt;Representative Simulations for

Wang, X.-J. and Buzsaki G. (1996) Gamma oscillations by synaptic inhibition in a
hippocampal interneuronal network.  J. Neurosci. 16, 6402-6413.

Fig. 1a
Small discrepancies between gif background in Grapher and the simulation is
probably due to slightly incorrect scaling and origin of the gif.

Default parameters replicate Fig. 3A (phi0=5; current injection amp0=1 muA/cm2).
Fig. 3B parameters are (phi0=3.3; amp0=1.2); 3C (phi0=2.0; amp0=1.4).

Note: this simulation takes a little more than 3 minutes on a 2GH linux machine.
Start the simulation by pressing the Run button or the Init&amp;Run; button.
When the simulation stops, press the &quot;Spike plot&quot; button and the
&quot;Plot cells A&amp;B;&quot; button.

Parameter control panel permits change in parameters as follows:

phi             phi0
Current inj.    amp0
Run             redundant with run button on run control
Randomize       rerandomizes initial conditions 
                (Chosen as a uniform distribution between -68 and -55 mV;
                 this range was chosen to give sync at approximately the cycle
                 seen in the paper.)
Spike Plot      Put up a graph of spike times 
                (Note that you can stop simulation, put up a graph, and restart.
                 This graph is only a snapshot and will not be updated.)
Plot cells A&amp;B;  Overlay 2 cells' voltage plots.  Cell # chosen below must be
                between 0 and 99.  Horizontal lines are drawn at -52 and -75 mV to 
                compare with right-side graphs of Fig. 3 in paper.
Cell A          Choose cell to plot.
Cell B          Choose other cell to plot.

Technical notes:

In the original paper, current injection is given
  in units of mA/cm2.  Here we have chosen a cell size of 100um/cm2
so that nA is equivalent to mA/cm2.
  
In the original paper, phi directly alters the time constant as a factor in the
  differential equation.  In this implementation, phi(phi0) alters celsius appropriately.

The value of Ra for figures 3,4,5 is 160 instead of the 180 stated in the
paper.

In fig 9 the dt plot can vary in details from the figure due to
changes in implementation and cvode upgrades. A value of 1e-10 is added
to dt before taking the log10 because dt=0 at stimulus discontinuities.
Also we display the order used by cvode as a function of time.

Usage notes:

On all platforms:

This model has been verified under NEURON 5.7.159 on mswin
unix and mac platforms.  The radio buttons for Figs. 1-8 generate the 
corresponding figures automatically.  Figure 9 actually requires a 
click on Init &amp; Run (e.g. so users can explore effects of changing 
absolute tolerance),

mswin: Auto-launch (ModelDB) or download and extract the zip file.
Then double click on mosinit.hoc in windows explorer.

unix: Auto-launch, or download and extract the archive.  Then type 
nrngui mosinit.hoc
at the command line after cd'ing to the hines2001 directory.

mac OS X: Download the archive.  Drag and drop the archive on the mos2nrn 
icon in the Neuron application directory.

The channel information for Fig. 9 is the same as Mainen &amp; Sejnowski
http://senselab.med.yale.edu/senselab/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=2488
and the cell type is Neocortical pyramidal neuron: deep
The cell for Figs. 7 and 8 is a Dentate granule cell.

h channel-dependent deficit of theta oscillation resonance and phase shift 
in temporal lobe epilepsy,
Neurobiol Dis. 2008 Dec 16. [Epub ahead of print]

In the paper, this model was used to confirm and support experimental data
suggesting that the neuronal/circuitry changes associated with temporal lobe epilepsy,
including Ih-dependent inductive mechanisms, can disrupt hippocampal theta function.

The simulation theta.hoc reproduces the upper left trace in Fig.5A of the paper.

  <description>
   Purkinje neurons spontaneously generate action potentials in the absence of synaptic drive and thereby exert a tonic, yet plastic, input to their target cells in the deep cerebellar nuclei. Purkinje neurons express two ionic currents with biophysical properties that are specialized for high-frequency firing: resurgent sodium currents and potassium currents mediated by Kv3.3. &amp;hellip; Numerical simulations indicated that Kv3.3 increases the spontaneous firing rate via cooperation with resurgent sodium currents. We conclude that the rate of spontaneous action potential firing of Purkinje neurons is controlled by the interaction of Kv3.3 potassium currents and resurgent sodium currents.  See paper for more and details.Reference: Akemann W, Knopfel T (2006) Interaction of Kv3 potassium channels and resurgent sodium current influences the rate of spontaneous firing of Purkinje neurons.  26:4602-12

  <description>
   &quot;The spatial and temporal patterns of action potential initiations were studied in a behaving leech preparation to determine the basis of increased firing that accompanies sensitization, a form of non-associative learning requiring the
S-interneurons.

...
The S-interneurons, one in each ganglion and linked by electrical synapses with both neighbors to form a chain, are interposed between sensory
and motor neurons.

...
 the single site with the largest initiation rate, the S-cell in the
stimulated segment, suppressed initiations in adjacent ganglia.

Experiments showed this was both because (1) it received the earliest, greatest input and (2) the delayed synaptic
input to the adjacent S-cells coincided with the action potential refractory period.

A compartmental model of the S-cell and its inputs showed that a simple, intrinsic mechanism of inexcitability after each action potential may account for suppression of impulse initiations.

Thus, a non-synaptic competition between neurons alters synaptic integration in the chain.

In one mode, inputs to different sites sum independently, whereas in another, synaptic input to a single site precisely specifies the overall pattern of activity.&quot;

cell synapses of rat cerebellum: experimental observations and
theoretical predictions.&quot; Nieus T, Sola E, Mapelli J, Saftenku E,
Rossi P, D'Angelo E.  J Neurophysiol. 2006 Feb;95(2):686-99&quot;

These files were contributed by Thierry Nieus.

The scripts reproduce Figure 7 of the paper. The control condition,
release probability (U) = 0.416, is set by default. To reproduce the
right panel of the figure set release probability, the variable ''MF
to GRC synapse Prel'', equal to 0.6.

To run:
-------
Either auto-launch from ModelDB (after NEURON, available from
http://www.neuron.yale.edu, is installed) or
1) download and extract the files.
2) Compile the mod files as usual on your platform (run mknrndll under
windows, execute nrnivmodl in the extracted directory under linux, or
drag and drop the extracted folder onto the mknrndll icon under mac os
x).
3) Then start mosinit.hoc (double click on mosinit.hoc in windows,
type &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot; in linux, or drag and drop the mosinit.hoc
file onto the nrngui icon in mac os x).

Once the simulation is running press the Init &amp; Run button.  The
following panels relevant to the left panel of Figure 7 will be
generated:

   The model reproduces short term plasticity of the mossy fibre to granule cell synapse. To reproduce synaptic currents recorded in experiments, a model of presynaptic release was used to determine the concentration of glutamate in the synaptic cleft that ultimately determined a synaptic response. The parameters of facilitation and depression were determined deconvolving AMPA EPSCs.Reference: Nieus T, Sola E, Mapelli J, Saftenku E, Rossi P, D'Angelo E (2006) LTP regulates burst initiation and frequency at mossy fiber-granule cell synapses of rat cerebellum: experimental observations and theoretical predictions.  95:686-99

This is the readme for the model code associated with the paper:

Tseng SH, Tsai LY, Yeh SR (2008) Induction of high-frequency
oscillations in a junction-coupled network. J Neurosci 28:7165-73

These model files were supplied by Shin-Hua Tseng.

Usage notes:

The simulation model code was created in NEURON 6.2

(NEURON is available from http://www.neuron.yale.edu)

Follow the below procedure to easily observe oscillation results:

Either auto-launch from ModelDB or download and extract the archive
and then under

mswin:
------

Compile the mod files by running mknrndll
([Start]-&gt;[Programs]-&gt;[Neuron 6.2]-&gt;[mknrndll]), cd'ing to the extracted
folder and selecting to make the nrnmech.dll file.  Then start the
simulation by double clicking on the mosinit.hoc file while using the
windows explorer or run [Start]-&gt;[Programs]-&gt;[Neuron 6.2]-&gt;[nrngui],
Change to model directory (from NEURON main menu select [File] -&gt;
[working dir]), and then load the load &quot;mosinit.hoc&quot; hoc file from
NEURON menubar [File]-&gt;[load hoc]

MAC OS X:
---------

Drag and drop the HOF folder onto the mknrndll icon.  Drag and drop
the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

Linux/Unix:
-----------

Compile the mod files by cd'ing to the extracted folder, HOF, and type

nrnivmodl
nrngui mosinit.hoc

Once the simulation interface has started:
------------------------------------------

From [RunControl], press [Init&amp;Run;] to show simulation results.

You should see a figure appear that looks like:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=114735&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\HFO\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

which contains similar data as was used to create figure 2d:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=114735&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\HFO\.\slide.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;slide&quot; /&gt;

Note:
You can use 
gap_r function to change gap junction resistance of each neuron pair
    gap_r() will show its usage.
Set_ST to adjust stimulation interval and strength
    Set_ST() will show its usage.

   Here we showed experimentally that high frequency oscillations (up to 600 Hz) were easily induced in a purely gap-junction coupled network by simple two stimuli with very short interval. The root cause is that the second elicited spike suffered from slow propagation speed and failure to transmit through a low-conductance junction. Similiar results were also obtained in these simulation.Reference: Tseng SH, Tsai LY, Yeh SR (2008) Induction of high-frequency oscillations in a junction-coupled network.  28:7165-73

On the MAC drag and drop the Ga_demo folder onto the mknrndll icon.
Then drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

--------------

When the simulation starts a window with button choices will appear.
You can graph the performance of the best individual in the initial
starting population by clicking on the &quot;Show best individual from
initial population&quot; button.  Click on the button labeled &quot;Show result
of GA&quot; to see a result of evolution of the model through 600
populations in the GA.  Clicking on &quot;Show final result of GA+praxis&quot;
shows how the praxis method built into NEURON refined the GA result.

To run the entire demonstration training session click the &quot;Start
training&quot; button.  When complete (after about 2 hours on a PC) you
will see matches for activation (the blue target curves are on top of
the red search results):

   &quot;... Here we show that a genetic search algorithm in combination with a gradient descent algorithm can be used to
fit whole-cell voltage-clamp data to kinetic models with a high degree of accuracy. Previously, ion channel stimulation
traces were analyzed one at a time, the results of these analyses being combined to produce a picture of channel
kinetics. Here the entire set of traces from all stimulation protocols are analysed simultaneously. The algorithm was
initially tested on simulated current traces produced by several Hodgkin-Huxley&amp;ndash;like and Markov chain models of
voltage-gated potassium and sodium channels. ... Finally, the algorithm was used for finding the kinetic parameters of several voltage-gated
sodium and potassium channels models by matching its results to data recorded from layer 5 pyramidal neurons
of the rat cortex in the nucleated outside-out patch configuration. The minimization scheme gives electrophysiologists
a tool for reproducing and simulating voltage-gated ion channel kinetics at the cellular level.&quot;Reference: Gurkiewicz M, Korngreen A (2007) A Numerical Approach to Ion Channel Modelling Using Whole-Cell Voltage-Clamp Recordings and a Genetic Algorithm  3(8):1633-1647

   &lt;pre&gt;This example produces a soma trajectory similar to that shown in fig 7a
of Archie, K.A. and Mel, B.W. A model of
intradendritic computation of binocular disparity
Nature Neuroscience 3:54-63, 2000.  Differences are due to synaptic noise.
Successive runs will produce different trajectories in response to randomly
computed synaptic event times.

The out.gif file shows the trajectory first obtained by launching the
mosinit.hoc file.

This example is based on the files from
http://www-lnc.usc.edu/~karchie/synmap/ but includes
a sample geom.Rin and grat_0_0.75.all.in
(generated from an optimal response grating)
file to allow autolaunch of the
example via the mosinit.hoc file. The changes to allow autolaunch consist
of moving the mod files from a subdirectory to the top level and a test
in hoc/synapses.hoc to allow automatic loading of the grat...in file.

The code which generates synaptic input files (not present in this
example but see the Readme_karchie file for a copy of the instructions
for that package) has been superseded by
the package at http://www-lnc.usc.edu/snv/
&quot;SNV is a package for generating realistic spike trains in NEURON
simulations. Users create stimulus &quot;movies,&quot; use linear-nonlinear cascade
models to generate the response of afferent neurons then map those
responses into synapses in specified locations on a cell.&quot;

Please contact karchie@lnc.usc.edu with questions about the paper, model
parameters, and usage of the snv system. Contact michael.hines@yale.edu
for questions about running this example.

McCormick DA, Pape HC.
Properties of a hyperpolarization-activated cation current 
and its role in rhythmic oscillation in thalamic relay neurones.
J. Physiol. 1990 431:291-318.

Running the kinetics.hoc simulation file will show 
the activation steady-state, the time constant, a simple simulation
using a somatic current injection, and a family of curves
generated modeling the same protocol used in the experiments. 

Since the experimental values were not explicitly given in the paper,
the voltage dependence of the time constant for activation and
de-activation (Fig.3A) has been approximated with an arbitrary function
using a temperature of 36C, as in the experiments.
 
Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui kinetics.hoc

Under Windows using NEURON 5.2:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
kinetics.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Usage:
Auto-launch from ModelDB or download and extract the archive and then under

ms-win
------
Compile the mod files by running mknrndll and changing to the extracted
folder and selecting to create the nrnmech.dll.  Then double click on
the mosinit.hoc file

linux/unix
----------
Compile the mod files by running nrnivmodl in the extracted folder.  Then
run &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot;

mac os x
--------
Drag and drop the extracted folder onto the mknrndll icon.  Drag and drop
the mosinit.hoc file from the extracted folder onto the nrngui icon.

----------
Once the simulation starts you can create subplots of Fig 9 by clicking
the appropriately labeled buttons or you can create the whole figure by
clicking the create all of fig 9 button (lower right in control box)
and you will get a figure like:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=102288&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\RichyandStarfish\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

Note: The variable step method was used in this demo, if you would like
to run the simulation as in the publication you can run cvode_active(0).

The model files were supplied by Dr Saraga.

This model qualitatively reproduces figures 1-5.
Note that orthodromic stimulus amplitude is considerably different from
that noted in the paper. IClamp[0].amp was chosen to give qualitative similarity.
We attribute minor quantitative differences to the following:
1) The precise site of axon v vs t curve is not specified. We plot
axon.v(0.25).
2) The antidromic stimulus was unspecified.


The NEURON implementation of this model was prepared by Michael Hines.

   &lt;pre&gt;Recruitment in Hippocampal HFOs Model README file
=====================================================

This model creates the 120-cell hippocampal model in:

Stacey WC, Krieger A, and Litt B. (2011) Network recruitment to
coherent oscillations in a hippocampal computer model.
Journal of Neurophysiology 105(4):1464-1481.


To run the simulation
---------------------

1. Should be run in the normal (serial) installation of NEURON 6.1 or
above.  Most of the code is actually written for parallel
implementation, but several functions were added that are not able to
run in parallel.

2. Unpack the zip file, keeping the file structure intact (see below)

3. Compile the nrnmech file within the \mod directory according to
your system's requirements.  Move the nrnmech file to the root
directory.

4. Run recruit.hoc.

5. Currently the network creates the three files demonstrated in
Fig. 3.  Other specific parameters to simulate different conditions
need to be set as follows :

        within recruit.hoc
                Tstop           length of simulation in ms
                pyrthr          the threshold to which the random number
                                (0-100) is compared.  rnd &amp;gt; pyrthr
                                will create a noise event
                basketthr       same as above for synapses to basket cells
                gapstyle        whenever you alter the files in \parameters,
                                change this number and record what the
                                changes were
                sigfreq         frequency of periodic signal.  Not used in
                                this simulation

                driverthr       Noise level to the Drivers.  this number is
                                held constant, and saved in the
                                filename as &quot;_f##&quot;
                                &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;the four levels tested were: 55 (95
                                   Hz), 65 (75 hz), 80 (50 hz), 85 (40
                                   Hz)
                                
        within \parameters\recruitconn.dat

                this file lists all synaptic and gap junctional
                connections, based on the parameters of synapses.par

                the current recruitconn.dat has the full feedback
                network of pyr - basket - pyr connections described.
                &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;It also has gap junctions between 20 Drivers and
                    the 20 Neighbors.

                there are several additional recruitconn.dat files in
                the attached folder.  These simply need to be moved to
                the \parameters directory and renamed &quot;conn.dat&quot;

        \parameters\synapses.par

                Here the gmax of the synapses is changed.  For this
                paper, the gmax of the IE and EI synapses was
                constant.

                This was used to change the gap junctions' gmax to 0,
                0.01, or 0.001 in the last line.  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;It is currently
                set to 0.001

The matlab analysis uses the file &quot;figureanal.m&quot;, which calls
&quot;tricolorspikeraster.m&quot;

FILE EXPLANATIONS
=================

Program run in the root directory, and calls files in several branched
directories as listed below.  The program is run from a batch file
that saves several parameters into the file names

Note that the program was originally written in parallel format, and
is based on legacy code written by Maciej Lazarewicz that was some of
the first parallel code used in NEURON, before the parallel version
was out of alpha.  There have been many modifications since then, some
of which do not work in parallel.  It is for this reason that the gap
junctions were done with the parallel format directly in the TGnet.tem
rather than the pointer method.

Unfortunately, the parallel idiom, which is slightly different even
than the current standard parallel idiom, can make this code difficult
to follow.  Because of several reasons, this code is not ready for
parallel implementation.  However, it is an excellent candidate for
the &quot;bulletin board&quot; style parallel that is currently being developed.
        

root folders:
        
        \templates

                ****recruitnet.tem //main program to build the network
                                     and gene rate stimuli and noise
                ****PYRkop.tem  //template for the pyramidal cells
                ****Bwb.tem  //template for basket cells                
                Ok.tem    // Okn cells not used
                several others  //not used
                
        \mod
                has all the channels, synapses, and gap(not used) .mod files
                
        \parameters

                // this folder is where the connectivity and
                conductance values are changed for different runs has
                .dat and .par files that contain the parameters that
                will be read in
                These files must be manually altered to change the
                        parameters.  I used the parameter &quot;gapstyle&quot;
                        in the netrun.hoc to indicate which parameter
                        set I had used for gmax's (had to keep track
                        of this separately&quot; also have .tem files for
                        cells and synapses

                
        \library
                //not used
        \data
                // all data saved here.  Each run creates a different
                filename to be saved


The main folder has the .hoc executable (there are many different
versions, all variations of below)
          *****recruit.hoc   //main .hoc file
                loads in /templates/recruitnet.tem
                sets many flags and parameters
                DoRun() is the main executable
                        pr = new TGnet()   //from template folder

                                which contains all functions in
                                recruitnet.tem, as well as having
                                .pnm. class
                        pr.pnm.want_all_spikes()

                        pr.activeSynapsesRandom(.....)  generates
                                random synaptic events in all the
                                cells
                        pr.signalSynapse(....)  adds a periodic input
                                to a specific pyramidal cell
                        pr.pnm.psolve(Tstop)
                        pr.pnm.gatherspikes()
                        writes files per flags
                        pr.pnm.pc.gid_clear()

                I make runs of files by changing parameters then
                calling DoRun(), over and over


Note that, although written in pnm.pc format, I have never compiled
NEURON that way--I've just run it in basic serial format.

   &quot;... Here we demonstrate, via a detailed computational model, a mechanism whereby physiological noise and coupling initiate oscillations and then recruit neighboring tissue, in a manner well described by a combination of Stochastic Resonance and Coherence Resonance.

 We develop a novel statistical method to quantify recruitment using several measures of network synchrony.

This measurement demonstrates that oscillations spread via preexisting network connections such as interneuronal connections, recurrent synapses, and gap junctions, provided that neighboring cells also receive sufficient inputs in the form of random synaptic noise.

This is the readme for the model files associated with the paper:

Larkum ME, Nevian T, Sandler M, Polsky A, Schiller J (2009) Synaptic
integration in tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons: a new 
unifying principle. Science 325:756-60

These NEURON model files were supplied by Alon Polsky.

Usage: to run the model either auto-launch from ModelDB or
download and extract this archive and then compile the mod
files under

mswin: run mknrndll and select this folder to create the nrnmech.dll
linux: run nrnivmodl in this folder
mac os x: drag and drop this folder onto mknrndll

then to start the simulation under

mswin: double click the mosinit.hoc file using windows explorer
linux: type &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot; in the shell prompt in this folder
mac os x: drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon

Once the simulation is running:

To run the current injection simulations run the model adjust the
proximal or the distal IClamp processes &amp;ndash; 0.5nA works OK for the
distal and 0.9nA for the proximal processes.  To examine the effects
of NMDA spike initiation increase the gmax variable of the
&amp;lsquo;glutamate&amp;lsquo; point process. Other variables used in
&amp;lsquo;glutamate&amp;rsquo; are:

       e-the reversal potential (should be 0)
       ntar &amp;ndash; NMDA to AMPA ratio (in this point process gmax is the
            NMDA conductance, and the AMPA conductance is calculated
            based on the ntar value. So, for example, at gmax of 1nS
            and ntar of 10, the NMDA conductance would be 1nS and AMPA
            0.1nS)
       del-onset time of the first synaptic input 
       Tspike &amp;ndash; ISI presynaptic activations (for presynaptic input
            train) in ms.
       Nspike-number of presynaptic activations (for presynaptic input
            train). For example, presynaptic train of 5 inputs at
            100Hz can be activated with Tspike=5 Nspike=10.

Summation of different distribution of synapses can be examined with
the &amp;lsquo;Control&amp;rsquo; panel.

numS variable is the number of synapses
GmaxS is the conductance of a single synapse (similar to gmax of
&amp;lsquo;glutamate&amp;rsquo; process
Synapses can be distributed based on distance from the main
bifurcation (between SubTuftProxS and SubTuftDistS values; only when
generation is 0) or dendrite generation.
Synapses can have either AMPA and NMDA components when the (NMDA=1;
AMPA=2) value is 1 or AMPA only when the (NMDA=1; AMPA=2) value is 2.

Please note that in some cases the temperature and the GlobalRa
variables are not automatically set to the right values. Best
simulation time value is 200ms.

---
When the simulation starts it displays a default location of synapses:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=124043&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\larkumEtAl2009_2\.\screenshot2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pict of synapse locations&quot; /&gt;

and pressing &quot;Init &amp; Run&quot; will produce the simulations default display:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=124043&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\larkumEtAl2009_2\.\screenshot1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;default parameter simulation&quot; /&gt;

Detailed instructions on generating panels from supplementary Fig. S2:

Here are the instructions for how to create simulations similar as to
presented at fig. S2:

For a simulation of NMDA spike (panel C) set the 'global Ra' to any
value between 80 to 90ohm-cm and press 'run'. The glutamatergic
synapse is located at the appropriate location and should generate 3
impulses with NMDA spike following the second impulse.
Setting global Ra to 85 ohm-cm produced this graph:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=124043&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\larkumEtAl2009_2\.\screenshot3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;panel C example&quot; /&gt;

For a simulation of synaptic summation (panels G and H) fist set the
gmax value of the glutamatergic synapse (point process glutamate[200])
to zero. Then redistribute 100 synapses over the 3rd order branches by
setting the 'generation' value in the 'Control' panel to 3. Set the
numS to 100 (number of synapses) and GmaxS to 1 (conductance of each
synapse in nS). Hit 'run' to generate a plot similar to panel G:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=124043&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\larkumEtAl2009_2\.\screenshot4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;panel G example&quot; /&gt;

In order to examine what is the effect of AMPA only synapses, change
the value of 'NMDA=1 AMPA=2' field in 'control' panel to 2. Hit 'run'
to generate the left part of plot H:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=124043&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\larkumEtAl2009_2\.\screenshot5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;left part of plot H&quot; /&gt;

In order to increase the number of synapses set the 'numS' value to a
higher number (500 will produce a similar result as to presented at
plot H, right part):

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=124043&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\larkumEtAl2009_2\.\screenshot6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;right part of plot H&quot; /&gt;

As the synapses are distributed randomly, each run's result is unique,
and may be somewhat different from the simulation presented in the
paper.

                           Neocortical Column Demo Readme
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains the source code from the paper:
  Synaptic information transfer in computer models of neocortical columns.
  Article by SA Neymotin, KM Jacobs, AA Fenton, and WW Lytton
  Journal of Computational Neuroscience (2010), in press.
  PubMed ID 20556639.

It allows simulating the activity of a neocortical column using
conductance- based neurons. In addition, NEURON vector implementations
of normalized transfer entropy are provided in infot.mod. For more
information on methods used, please see the paper.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Compilation/running instructions (LINUX)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need the NEURON simulator in order to run this simulation.
It is available for download at http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/
Detailed installation instructions are available there as well.

Once you have NEURON installed you will need to compile the .mod files
included in the zip file. To do so first extract the contents of the
zip file into a single flat directory.

If you are on LINUX/UNIX then run nrnivmodl *.mod from the command
line to compile the .mod files. If this is done properly, an
executable named 'special' will be produced in the x86_64 subdirectory
(on 64 bit machines) or x86 subdirectory on 32 bit machines.

(If you are using WINDOWS this is not guaranteed to work but try the
instructions at:
http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/docs/nmodl/mswin.html for more
information on compiling new mechanisms into NEURON .)

Next, to run the simulation enter the following command at the command
prompt:
  ./x86_64/special (or ./x86/special )

This will begin the NEURON simulator.  You will then be at the NEURON
command prompt which should look like this: oc&amp;gt; Type
load_file(&quot;mosinit.hoc&quot;) and press enter.  This will start the
neocortical column simulation.  A GUI window will be displayed that
will allow running the simulation and displaying output consisting of:

 1. spike raster
 2. local field potential
 3. voltage of several cells with different dynamical properties

We sought to measure how the activity of the network alters information flow from inputs to output patterns. 
Information handling by the network reflected the degree of internal connectivity. ...
With greater connectivity strength, the recurrent network translated activity and information due to contribution of activity from intrinsic network dynamics. 
...
At still higher internal synaptic strength, the network corrupted the external information, producing a state where little external information came through.
The association of increased information retrieved from the network with increased gamma power supports the notion of gamma oscillations playing a role in information processing.&quot;

This model reproduces figures 1 and 2. On launch it simulates fig 2b.
Note that the myelin locations for voltage plots for fig 2b differ from the
paper by half a segment length. That is, in the paper the locations are at
x=.1, .2, .3, ..., .9 whereas in this simulation the centers of the 10 myelin
segments are at x = .05, .15, .25, ..., .95

The NEURON implementation of this model was prepared by Michael Hines.
Questions about details of this implementation should be addressed to him

   &lt;pre&gt;NEURON mod files from the paper:

Michele Migliore and Gordon M Shepherd
Dendritic action potentials connect distributed dendrodendritic microcircuits
J. Comp. Neurosci. (2007) (online first).

The simulation file can be used to reproduce the bottom left histogram
in Fig.3,representing the M2 mitral cell firing in the presence of the
GCs network.  In the simulation window, &quot;odor&quot; is the number of odor
input (3-11), and traces for the 3 Mitral cells are plotted using
different colors.

To start, auto-launch from ModelDB or

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui mosinit.hoc

Under Windows systems:

to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; program on the folder
expanded from this archive, then double click on the simulation file
mosinit.hoc to start the simulation.

Under MAC OS X:

Expand the MC-GC.zip archive after downloading it.  Drag the MC-GC
folder onto the mknrndll icon in the NEURON application folder.  Drag
the mosinit.hoc file in the MC-GC folder onto the nrngui icon in the
NEURON application folder.

For each platform:

Enter the odor number next to the odor button, press Run, and count
the number of M2 APs (red trace).  Repeat for odors 3 through 11.

   This model shows how backpropagating action potentials in the long lateral dendrites of mitral cells, together with granule cell actions on mitral cells within narrow columns forming glomerular units, can provide a mechanism to activate strong local inhibition between arbitrarily distant mitral cells.  The simulations predict a new role for the dendrodendritic synapses in the multicolumnar organization of the granule cells.Reference: Migliore M, Shepherd GM (2008) Dendritic action potentials connect distributed dendrodendritic microcircuits  24(2):207-221

This model was developed for the paper:

Tiago Branco, Beverley Clark and Michael Hausser Dendritic
discrimination of temporal input sequences in cortical neurons.
Science. 2010 Sep 24;329(5999):1671-5. Epub 2010 Aug 12.

It has also been used for all simulations presented in:

Tiago Branco and Michael Hausser 
Synaptic integration gradients in single cortical pyramidal cell
dendrites.  Neuron. 2011 Mar 10;69(5):885-92.


The directory contains the NEURON mod and hoc files necessary to
reproduce the basic sequence sensitivity result shown in Fig. S5 panel
B in Branco et al. 2010:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=140828&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\Branco_2010\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fig S5 simulation&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;

The above was generated from octave by plotting the matrix tempV.dat
which is written from the simulation.  The traces correspond to the
AMPA+NMDA (there are actually four more traces per sequence in the
simulation; in the paper the time intervals shown are from 0-5 ms).
The code was developed and tested using NEURON 7.1 under Linux.  To
run: auto-launch from ModelDB or install by unzipping Branco_2010.zip
into a folder, compile the mod files and start &quot;init_sim.hoc&quot;.  For
further information please contact Tiago Branco at t.branco@ucl.ac.uk.

Description of files:

./rc19.hoc Cell morphology. Cm has been doubled in apical and basal
           dendrites to account for dendritic spines.

./init_biophys.hoc Set biophysical parameters. Includes procedures to
           add active conductances to soma, axon and basal dendrites.

./init_synapses.hoc Procedures to add AMPA and NMDA synapses. If using
                    active dendrites edit NMDAgmax as indicated.

./synapse_loc.dat Location of synapses in the basal dendritic
		tree. Left-hand side column is the number of the basal
		dendrite and right-hand side the relative position of
		the synapse in the dendrite (1 is distal, 0 is
		proximal). First line has the number of lines and
		number of columns. To add/change the position and
		number of synapses edit this file and update the first
		line accordingly.
			
./synapse_order.dat Temporal sequences to be tested. Each number
		corresponds to a synapse (in the current format there
		are 9 synapses, 0 is the most distal and 8 the most
		proximal), and the sequence defines the order of
		activation of each synapse.  The two sequences in the
		file correspond to the IN and OUT sequences
		respectively. First line has the number of lines and
		number of columns. To test more sequences just add
		them to the file and update the first line.
			
./init_sim Starts the simulation. Currently set to passive mode,
		uncomment lines where indicated to switch to active
		model. The simulation runs through each of the
		sequences defined in synapse_order, and for each
		sequence tests different stimulation intervals set by
		the variable &quot;nTs&quot;. This is currently set to 10, which
		results in iterating from 0 (ie: simultaneous
		activation) to 9 ms in steps of 1 ms.

temporo-septal engram shift model.
Neuroreport, 10:2301--2306, 1999.

This example produces Fig. 1 p 2302 as shown in fig1.gif.  The
simulation takes several minutes and the progress is indicated in the
console window by printing the time approximately every 300 ms.  At 5000
ms, the figure will be displayed in two graph windows.  The raster plot
will probably be hidden underneath the plot of Net[20].soma.v(0.5)
NB: the first cycle of stimulation produces an initialization artifact
(bursting in all cells) that is not shown in the original figure. 

For questions about the model contact Bill Lytton at
billl@neurosim.downstate.edu

Michael Hines made some non-substantive changes to vecst.mod (derived
from vecst.mod.orig) to allow running the model under mswin and on the
mac.  The most significant being the incorporation of a free version of
srand/drand from
http://www.mit.edu/afs/athena/activity/c/cgs/src/math/drand48/
 Under mswin, this model can only be run using NEURON version 5.2
2002/02/28 or later since it makes use of calls to sprintf and
hoc_obj_file_arg which were not exported by earlier versions.  On a MAC
you may need to increase the memory size for NEURON to 24MB.

   Temporo-septal engram shift model of hippocampal memory. The model posits that memories gradually move along the hippocampus from a temporal encoding site to ever more septal sites from which they are recalled. We propose that the sense of time is encoded by the location of the engram along the temporo-septal axis.Reference: Lytton WW, Lipton P (1999) Can the hippocampus tell time?

Submillisecond AMPA receptor-mediated signaling at a principal 
neuron-interneuron synapse.
Neuron 1997 Jun;18(6):1009-23

Abstract:
Glutamatergic transmission at a principal neuron-interneuron synapse 
was investigated by dual whole-cell patch-clamp recording in rat 
hippocampal slices combined with morphological analysis. Evoked EPSPs 
with rapid time course (half duration = 4 ms; 34 degrees C) were 
generated at multiple synaptic contacts established on the interneuron 
dendrites close to the soma. The underlying postsynaptic conductance 
change showed a submillisecond rise and decay, due to the precise timing
of glutamate release and the rapid deactivation of the postsynaptic AMPA 
receptors. Simulations based on a compartmental model of the interneuron 
indicated that the rapid postsynaptic conductance change determines the 
shape and the somatodendritic integration of EPSPs, thus enabling 
interneurons to detect synchronous principal neuron activity.


For Auto-launch...

One can create figures similar to fig8b and fig 8c from the paper by hand once
the program has started.  Pressing the &quot;Estimate of fig 8d&quot; button leads to
the generation of a figure similar to the one in the paper.  See the fig8d.hoc
file for modifications for higher resolution.
-------
for manual running...
After the mod file is compiled to make the syn2 mechanism available
currentclamp.hoc can be run with the procedure suitable for your platform.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

   Glutamatergic transmission at a principal neuron-interneuron synapse was investigated by dual whole-cell patch-clamp recording in rat hippocampal slices combined with morphological analysis and modeling. Simulations based on a compartmental model of the interneuron indicated that the rapid postsynaptic conductance change determines the shape and the somatodendritic integration of EPSPs, thus enabling interneurons to detect synchronous principal neuron activity.Reference: Geiger JR, Lubke J, Roth A, Frotscher M, Jonas P (1997) Submillisecond AMPA receptor-mediated signaling at a principal neuron-interneuron synapse.

   &lt;pre&gt;ENCODING AND RETRIEVAL IN A MODEL OF THE HIPPOCAMPAL CA1 MICROCIRCUIT
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This NEURON code implements a small network model (100 pyramidal cells
and 4 types of inhibitory interneuron) of storage and recall of patterns
in the CA1 region of the mammalian hippocampus. Patterns of PC activity
are stored either by a predefined weight matrix generated by Hebbian learning,
or by STDP at CA3 Schaffer collateral AMPA synapses.

Abstract:
It has been proposed that the hippocampal theta rhythm (4-7 Hz) can 
contribute to memory formation by separating encoding (storage) and 
retrieval of memories into different functional half-cycles 
(Hasselmo et al., 2002). We investigate, via computer simulations, 
the biophysical mechanisms by which storage and recall of spatio-temporal 
input patterns are achieved by the CA1 microcircuitry. A model of the CA1 
microcircuit is presented that uses biophysical representations of the 
major cell types, including pyramidal (P) cells and four types of inhibitory
interneurons: basket (B) cells, axo-axonic (AA) cells, bistratified (BS) cells 
and oriens lacunosum-molecurale (OLM) cells. Inputs to the network come from 
the entorhinal cortex (EC), the CA3 Schaffer collaterals and medial septum. 
The EC input provides the sensory information, whereas all other inputs provide 
context and timing information. Storage is accomplished via a local STDP mediated
hetero-association of the EC input pattern and the incoming CA3 input pattern on 
the pyramidal cell target synapses. The model simulates the timing of firing of
different hippocampal cell types relative to the theta rhythm in anaesthetized 
animals and proposes experimentally confirmed functional roles for the different 
classes of inhibitory interneurons in the storage and recall cycles 
(Klausberger et al., 2003, 2004). Measures of recall performance of new and 
previously stored input patterns in the presence or absence of various inhibitory
interneurons are employed to quantitatively test the performance of our model. 
Finally, the mean recall quality of the CA1 microcircuit is tested as the number 
of stored patterns is increased.

Main file: HAM_StoRec_par.hoc (parallel version)
           HAM_StoRec_ser.hoc (serial version - VERY SLOW! auto-launch from modeldb
                               runs this version.)

These files are configured to produce the results presented in figures 9 and 10
of the paper, showing recall of a stored pattern when the entorhinal cortex input
is disconnected from the CA1 pyramidal cells and so pattern recall is cued 
exclusively by CA3 Schaffer collateral input. Example results are in the Results
directory, in which there are also Matlab files for plotting them.
EC input can be restored by setting ECWGT to its non-zero value.
Other results were produced by setting particular connection weight variables to 0
to remove certain synaptic pathways.

Markaki M, Orphanoudakis S, Poirazi P (2005) Modelling reduced
excitability in aged CA1 neurons as a calcium-dependent process
Neurocomputing 65-66:305-314

These model files were supplied by Dr Poirazi.

The model files were changed slightly after the paper however they
reproduce the traces in Figure 3.

Usage 
-----
Auto-launch from ModelDB or download and extract the archive and then

unix/linux
----------
Compile the mod files with &quot;nrnivmodl mechanism&quot; , then start with
&quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot;

mswin
-----
Compile the mod files with mknrndll.  Move the nrnmech.dll up one
level to the top level directory.  Double click on mosinit.hoc in a
windows explorer.

Once the simulation has started press the run button to generate
figures similar to the traces in Figure 2 (increased Ca2+):

   &quot;We use a multi-compartmental model of a CA1 pyramidal cell to study changes in hippocampal excitability that result from aging-induced alterations in calcium-dependent membrane mechanisms.

The model incorporates N- and L-type calcium channels which are respectively coupled to fast and slow afterhyperpolarization potassium channels.

Model parameters are calibrated using physiological data.

Computer simulations reproduce the decreased excitability of aged CA1 cells, which results from increased internal calcium accumulation, subsequently larger postburst slow afterhyperpolarization, and enhanced spike frequency adaptation.

We find that aging-induced alterations in CA1 excitability can be modelled with simple coupling mechanisms that selectively link specific types of calcium channels to specific calcium-dependent potassium channels.&quot;Reference: Markaki M, Orphanoudakis S, Poirazi P (2005) Modelling reduced excitability in aged CA1

At launch this example quantitatively reproduces figure 5 of the paper.
The window appearance is shown in fig5.gif.

For questions about the model contact Bill Lytton at
billl@neurosim.downstate.edu

NB: program uses SNS synaptic formalism that predates NetCon.
Also it supplies its own standard run library so Graphs
from the NEURONMainMenu will not work. Run different
patterns with
	show(2)
where the 2 may be replaced by an integer in the range from 0 to 59.
The results of each run will be displayed in the tray after the run.

The 'WARNING nsyn==0' messages are irrelevant for this example.

Some non-substantive changes to the original code were made by Michael Hines
to allow it to run on mswin and mac os. Under mswin, this model can only
be run using NEURON version 5.2 2002/02/28 or later since it makes use of
calls to sprintf and hoc_obj_file_arg which were not exported by earlier
versions. On a MAC you may need to increase the memory size for NEURON
to 24MB.

  <description>
   A biologically-detailed model of the mammalian olfactory bulb, incorporating 
the mitral and granule cells and the dendrodendritic synapses between them. 
The results of simulation experiments with electrical stimulation agree 
closely in most details with published experimental data. The model predicts 
that the time course of dendrodendritic inhibition is dependent on the 
network connectivity as well as on the intrinsic parameters of the synapses. 
In response to simulated odor stimulation, strongly activated mitral cells 
tend to suppress neighboring cells, the mitral cells readily synchronize 
their firing, and increasing the stimulus intensity increases the degree of 
synchronization. For more details, see the reference below.Reference: Davison AP, Feng J, Brown D (2003) Dendrodendritic inhibition and simulated odor responses in a detailed olfactory bulb network model.  90:1921-1935

2. Running the model

Either auto-launch the model from ModelDB and then explore the model
with Tools -&gt; modelview or hit the start button and wait about 15
seconds for two abreviated runs (1000 seconds of simulation time each)
which should produce a network activity graph similar to Fig. 6b1 and
Fig. 8b except the bursts are not identified:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=127388&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\BGnet\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;

Or:

First, recompile the mod files to generate a nrnmech.dll as needed for
your system (eg mknrndll or nrnivmodl).  Simulations are run by
loading or executing parBGLaunch.hoc, which initializes the model and
executes commands in a script file.  The script file is named
pBGLaunch.nnn, where 'nnn' is an integer entered by the user at the
prompt.  A sample script is included and described below
(pBGLaunch.000) that runs a simulation in MPTP mode and then runs it
again with DBS inputs active.  For both runs population statistics as
well as spike times are saved in text files.

saveData(netNum, res)			//append results to a file stats000.txt

sprint(str, &quot;spikes%03d.txt&quot;, runNum)	//put identifying number in filename
saveSpikes(str)				//save spike time data for all cells to spikes000.txt


quit()					//exit Neuron and close all windows

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note, omitting the last line will leave Neuron in the interactive mode
when the simulation has completed.  At that point, graph and run
windows may be opened and the simulation rerun.


3.  Platform notes

Neuron v5.8 was used to run simulations.  The included 'small net' has
50 cells (see pPARrun.txt) and runs well in a Windows XP environment.
Published data used 500 cells in the same ratio of 1:3:1
(STN:GPe:GPi).Data collection was performed on a 16 node cluster using
Neuron's network manager objects over MPI.  This model is currently
being ported to a Python version of Neuron.

This is the readme for the model published in 

Letzkus, Kampa &amp; Stuart (2006) Learning Rules for Spike
Timing-Dependent Plasticity Depend on Dendritic Synapse Location.
J Neurosci 26(41):10420-9.

The simulation creates several plots showing voltage and NMDA current
and conductance changes at different apical dendritic locations in
layer 5 pyramidal neurons during STDP induction protocols.

Usage:

Autolaunch from ModelDB **or** download and extract the archive and
then compile the mod files in the mod directory and run under ...

linux/unix
----------
by typing
nrnivmodl mod
in the top level directory.  Then type
nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin
-------

by running mknrndll, cd'ing to the mod directory and press make
nrnmech.dll button.  Copy the nrnmech.dll file to the parent directory
of the mod folder (the top-level directory).  Double click on the
mosinit.hoc file.

MAC OS X
--------

drag and drop the mod folder onto mknrndll icon in the NEURON
application folder.  Start a terminal window, cd to the directory
within the expanded archive and type 
mod/powerpc/special mosinit.hoc -
to start the simulation.

-------

Choose a pre-post interval (default +10 ms, i.e. post- synaptic action
potentials occur 10 ms after presynaptic EPSP stimulation). Dendritic
locations are 200 microns (proximal) or 800 microns (distal) from soma
as shown in figure 8 in Letzkus (2006).

Running the model in the default configuration should lead to:

Hodgkin, A.L., Huxley, A.F. (1952) A quantitative description of
membrane current and its application to conduction and
excitation in nerve. J. Physiol. 117: 500-544.

Notes:
	The gif files are copies of original fig3 and fig6. Red lines are
	polylines drawn using idraw. The polylines have control points
	as near as I can place them on the circles of the data. This idraw
	file is then read into neuron using idraw.hoc for translating, scaling
	and copying into a Vector display tool.

	The raw data in the Vector display tools, fig3k.ses and fig6na.ses
	are in units of mS/cm2. These curves were rescaled to S/cm2 in
	the MultipleRunFitter's. The computations in the fitters differ
	from the original model curves of figure 3 and 6 because the
	original model curves are fits to the data for the specific axon
	17 whereas the curves shown in these simulations are for the
	standard hh model.

	To see the simulated curves and data from a MultipleRunFitter,
	click on any item in the &quot;Generators&quot; list of the main MulRunFitter
	panel to pop up a generator viewer
	(It will be called MulRunFitter[0] Generators).
	Then in the main MulRunFitter panel select &quot;Generators/Run all&quot;.

   &lt;pre&gt;tmgsyn.mod is an implementation of a model of short-term synaptic 
plasticity using NEURON's model description language NMODL.

The model has been described by Tsodyks and collaborators in 
publications that include
  Tsodyks, M., Pawelzik, K., Markram, H.
  Neural networks with dynamic synapses.
  Neural Computation 10:821-835, 1998
and
  Tsodyks, M., Uziel, A., Markram, H.
  Synchrony generation in recurrent networks with
  frequency-dependent synapses.
  J. Neurosci. 2000 RC50.

This demonstration is patterned after Fig. 1A-C in the Neural 
Computation paper, except that the synapse is implemented with 
a conductance change, whereas Tsodyks et al. assumed that the 
synapse acted as a current source.


NOTES:

1.  The important part of this package of files is the synaptic 
mechanism, not the &quot;cells.&quot;  The synaptic mechanism is reusable 
in models of biophysical neurons.  The &quot;cells&quot; are merely 
single-compartment passive models whose sole purpose is to serve 
as leaky integrators.

2.  The presynaptic stimulus and its connection to the synaptic 
mechanism were implemented with NEURON's Artificial Cell and 
Network Builder tools.  For tutorials about how to use these tools, 
and information about NEURON's model description language NMODL, 
see the Documentation page at NEURON's WWW site 
( http://www.neuron.yale.edu/ )
especially the FAQ link on that page.

3.  If you are interested in other models of short term synaptic 
plasticity, see ModelDB for an implementation of the model 
described by

  and Nelson, S.B..

   The model allows reconstruction of evoked local field potentials as seen in the cerebellar granular layer. The approach uses a detailed model of cerebellar granule neuron to generate data traces and then uses a &quot;ReConv&quot; or jittered repetitive convolution technique to reproduce post-synaptic local field potentials in the granular layer. The algorithm was used to generate both in vitro and in vivo evoked LFP and reflected the changes seen during LTP and LTD, when such changes were induced in the underlying neurons by modulating release probability of synapses and sodium channel regulated intrinsic excitability of the cells.Reference: Diwakar S, Lombardo P, Solinas S, Naldi G, D`Angelo E (2011) Local field potential modeling predicts dense activation in cerebellar granule cells

   &lt;pre&gt;An example of a parallel run is
  mpiexec -n 12 nrniv -mpi parinit.hoc
which takes about an hour and
creates a weight-forfig3-bulb1.dat file and an out12.dat file
(the number of processors is used to construct the spike output file name).
The former contains the synapse weights at time 59900.
The latter contains the spike time, gid pairs for granule and mitral soma
and all the reciprocal synapse spike detectors (two per synapse).
When a simulation is carried out using more than one processor, the out.dat
file should be sorted with (taking the above example)
sort -k 1n,1n -k 2n,2n out12.dat &amp;gt; out.spk

To explore the results of a simulation run, use
  nrngui start.hoc

Quantitative identity of the spike output and weight files can only be
obtained if one uses NEURON -- Release 6.2.3 (2203) 2008-08-28
http://www.neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/v6.2/ More recent
versions of NEURON will give very similar results but not quantitatively
identical due to differences in the delivery event times when events do
not occur on time step boundaries for the fixed step method. 
(Note that pattern.hoc has been modified to read the 6.2.3.2203.spk
instead of an out.spk file)

The mosinit.hoc file runs start.hoc and shows a hinton plot of the weights at
time 59900.

   &lt;pre&gt;NEURON mod files for the Ca-T current from the paper:
Williams SR, Stuart GJ, Action potential backpropagation and 
somato-dendritic distribution of ion channels in thalamocortical neurons.
J Neurosci. 2000 20:1307-17.

Running the kinetics.hoc simulation file will show 
the activation and inactivation steady-states, the time constants, 
and a family of curves generated modeling the protocols 
indicated in the paper.

Parameters for the Boltzmann equation fitting
the activation (m^3) and inactivation (h) steady states
were those reported in the paper (p.1313).

Half activation/inactivation, 
prepulses, and test pulses, were reported in the paper as 
relative to a resting membrane potential, and the model 
uses the Nerst's equation to calculate the Calcium reversal potential. 
Thus, the model's parameter vrest_cat (the resting potential) 
and the initial values of Calcium concentrations (cao and cai)
need to be defined in hoc.

Time constants were not reported in the paper. In the model,
they have been adjusted to give a reasonable approximation of the
voltage-clamp current traces in Figs.8A-B.
 
Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui kinetics.hoc

Under Windows using NEURON 5.1:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
kinetics.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Usage:

The runs typically take tens of minutes so these simulations are best
run with batch scripts.  To recreate a figure similar to fig 6 in the
paper you can autolaunch from modeldb or download and extract the
archive then under

mswin
-----

Compile the mod files with mknrndll and then double click on the
mosinit.hoc

unix/linux
----------

Compile the mod files nrnivmodl then start the simulation with
nrngui mosinit.hoc

MAC OS X
--------

Drag and drop the folder created in the extraction onto the mknrndll
icon.  Drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

----------------

Once the simulation is started you can explore the model with the
graphical interface (see esp. the miscellaneous functions provided by
extras.hoc) or press the create fig 6 button which will generate a
panel similar to fig 6.  This takes tens of minutes to complete.  It
should generate a figure like this:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=114047&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\Basketcell\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

The models extend those described in

by using geometry of digitally reconstructed dendritic arborization of 
rat abducens motoneuron. 
Models 1 and 2 include, respectively, a moderately complex single dendrite 
and the whole arborization. They show how the membrane properties and 
stochastic geometry define the somatopetal current transfer from tonic 
excitatory synaptic inputs distributed over the dendrites. Introducing 
uniform steady synaptic conductivity in the dendritic membrane simulates 
such input. The extrasynaptic dendritic conductances were either passive or 
active, Hodgkin-Huxley type Na and K conductances. 
The simpler model 1 (Fig.2) shows effects of random branching and diameter 
variation on the contribution from each dendritic site to the total current 
reaching the soma. For that the NEURON programs compute and display the 
path profiles of the membrane voltage (A, E), total and partial 
conductivities (B, F), total current per unit membrane area (C, G) and the 
core current increment per unit path length (D, H). The latter is the 
estimate of the current transfer effectiveness. 
The heterogeneous depolarization increases with path distance from the soma 
with unequal rates (gradients) along different dendritic paths. The voltage 
path profiles diverge according to the branching asymmetry due to greater 
depolarization of longer sister paths. More depolarized dendritic sites 
generate inward membrane current of smaller density. Path profiles of the 
core current increment that is the product of the membrane current density 
and perimeter are modulated by randomly varying diameter (cf. Fig.2. D, H 
and Fig.1).
The complex model 2 (Fig.3) shows that, in the whole reconstructed 
arborization receiving distributed input, whatever are membrane properties, 
passive or Hodgkin-Huxley type active (B or C, respectively), the path 
profiles of depolarization form bundles, which correspond to those of the 
passive transfer effectiveness from single site inputs (A). The bundles 
indicate the groups of dendritic paths, which although hardly 
distinguishable, morphologically are functionally distinct due to 
between-group difference and within-group similarity of their electrical 
behavior. Random diameter variations perturb bundling of the path profiles 
of the current transfer from distributed sources (D).

Membrane mechanisms:


PasD.mod  - passive extrasynaptic and synaptic currents (models with passive 
	  dendrites)
PasS.mod  - passive synaptic current (models with active dendrites)
Hh1.mod  - sodium, potassium and leak currents of Hodgkin-Huxley type (models 
	   with active dendrites)
PasSA.mod: passive membrane current of the soma and axon (all models)

   Bal, T., Fregnac, Y., Markram, H. and Destexhe, A.
   Minimal Hodgkin-Huxley type models for different classes of
   cortical and thalamic neurons.
   Biological Cybernetics 99: 427-441, 2008.

Intrinsic currents: INa, IKd for action potentials, IM for
spike-frequency adaptation, ICaL for high-threshold calcium current,
ICaT for the low-threshold calcium current, intracellular calcium
dynamics.  

demo_PY_RS.oc : simplified model of the &quot;regular-spiking&quot; neuron
demo_IN_FS.oc : simplified model of the &quot;fast-spiking&quot; interneuron
demo_PY_IB.oc : simplified model of the &quot;intrinsically bursting&quot; neuron
demo_PY_IBR.oc : simplified model of the &quot;repetive bursting&quot; neuron
demo_PY_LTS.oc : simplified model of the &quot;low-threshold spike&quot; neurons

Usage:
------

Simply auto-launch from ModelDB (after NEURON is installed) or
download and extract the archive.  Then under

linux/unix:
-----------

cd to the extracted folder.  Type at the shell prompt:

nrnivmodl
nrngui mosinit.hoc

MAC OS X:
---------

Drag and drop the extracted folder onto the mknrndll icon.  Drag and
drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

mswin:
------

Run mknrndll and cd to the extracted folder. Select to make the
nrnmech.dll.  Use windows explorer to view the contents of the
expanded folder from the archive. Double click on the mosinit.hoc
file.

Once the simulation is started:
-------------------------------

Click on a button to select a cell.  Reposition the windows and press
the Init &amp; Run button.

For example selecting Bursting Pyramidal Cell and then Init &amp; Run
should produce a figure like figure 5B from the paper:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=123623&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\PospischilEtAl2008\.\fig5b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fig 5B appears here&quot; /&gt;

   &quot;We review here the development of Hodgkin&amp;ndash;
Huxley (HH) type models of cerebral cortex and thalamic
neurons for network simulations.

The intrinsic electrophysiological
properties of cortical neurons were analyzed from
several preparations, and we selected the four most prominent
electrophysiological classes of neurons.

These four classes
are &amp;ldquo;fast spiking&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;regular spiking&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;intrinsically bursting&amp;rdquo;
and &amp;ldquo;low-threshold spike&amp;rdquo; cells. For each class, we fit &amp;ldquo;minimal&amp;rdquo;
HH type models to experimental data.

   We introduce and operatively present a general method to simulate channel noise in conductance-based model neurons, with modest computational overheads.

Our approach may be considered as an accurate generalization of previous proposal methods,
to the case of voltage-, ion-, and ligand-gated channels with arbitrary complexity.

We focus on the discrete Markov process descriptions, routinely employed in experimental
identification of voltage-gated channels and synaptic receptors.Reference: Linaro D, Storace M, Giugliano M (2011) Accurate and fast simulation of channel noise in conductance-based model neurons by diffusion approximation  7:e1001102-

Impulse encoding mechanisms of ganglion cells in the

This model is initially setup to produce figure 1 automatically.
After viewing the currents, you may simulate figure 3a in the
followng way.
1) close the 6 graph windows.
2) Destroy the SEClamp object by executing the statement
	objref VoltageClamp
3) Select the
	NEURONMainMenu/File/LoadSession
menuitem and double click on the
	fig3a.ses
file.
4) press the Init&amp;Run; button.

The following parameter changes to the current working code supplied
by Bob Miller's lab were made in collaboration with
Michael Hines in order to
semi-quantitatively reproduce figures 1 and 3a.

1) Table 1 indicates that gnabar_spike = .05 S/cm2. However the curves
for the Na-current portion of Fig 1 use the default mod file value of
gnabar_spike = .04 .

2) The initial Ca Rev. Potential of Fig 1 requires that the Table 1 value
of celsius = 22 degC be used instead of NEURON's default value of 6.3.
This statement was added to the current.hoc file.

3) To get the fig 1 behavior of slowly increasing calcium concentration
with constant calcium current over 10 ms we modified current.hoc so that
depth_cad = 3 (microns)
taur_cad = 10 (ms)
instead of the working code values of 2.5 and 1.5 respectively.

4) The working code used a spherical soma of 5um in diameter. This
was changed to 25um as indicated in the paper and gives the results
of fig 3 when a current of .02 nA is injected which is the amount
specified in the paper.

The largest discrepancy is
that the amplitude of Ca-activated K-current is lower
in this example model than is indicated in fig 1 of the paper.

Questions about how to execute the model should be addressed to
michael.hines@yale.edu. Questions about parameters should
be addressed to

NEURON environment Neurocomputing 58-60:1117-1122, 2004.

The response of many types of integrate and fire cells to synaptic input
can be computed analytically and their threshold crossing either
computed analytically or approximated to high accuracy via Newton
approximation.  The NEURON simulation environment simulates networks of
such artificial spiking neurons using discrete event simulation
techniques in which computations are performed only when events are
received.  Thus computation time is proportional only to the number of
events delivered and is independent of the number of cells or problem
time. 

The first two panels of figure 1 are reproduced using the
fixed step method.

When the variable time step method is
selected the third panel looks quite different from the figure
after NEURON version 5.7.71 due to an improvment in NetStim.
The old version of NetStim sent a self-event
to itself .1 ms after each spike event so that it could reset a spike
variable used for plotting. The new version is more efficient
since it no longer sends this
extra event to itself and no longer manages the spike variable.
(Spike times are best recorded using NetCon.record(Vector).)
Therefore, even in the original figure the apparently
abrupt increases in IntFire1[0].M are not discontinuous but merely
the value of IntFire1[0].M after a 0.1 ms interval.
One can reproduce the third panel by creating another
IntFire1 cell, connecting NetCon's to it from the three NetStim's
and setting 0.1 ms delays for them. This will force the extra
returns from fadvance().

Note that fadvance() returns before the delivery of an event and,
for POINT_PROCESS models, after the delivery of an event. However
ARTIFICIAL_CELL models do not cause re-initialization
of the Cvode integrator when an event is delivered to them and therefore
fadvance() returns before but not after the delivery of the event.
Therefore if one wishes to capture the 0 interval discontinuities, one can
change ARTIFICIAL_CELL to POINT_PROCESS but at the cost of purposeless
Cvode initialization.

   &lt;pre&gt;Lindgren and Moore. (1989) Identification of ionic currents at
presynaptic nerve terminal of the lizard.
J. Physiol. 414: 201-222

Experimental observations of ionic currents localized in the presynaptic
terminal region were made with a focal loose-patch clamp.  In addition
to finding Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) type sodium and potassium currents an L
type calcium channel and a calcium-activated potassium channel were
identified. 

Computer simulations matching the invasion of the action potential
(figure 2) and the major current patterns (figure 1) were able to be
generated, using only the Na and K channels of HH

The NEURON implementation of this model was prepared by Michael Hines. 
Questions about details of this implementation should be addressed to
him at michael.hines@yale.edu.

This package is running with the NEURON simulation program written by
  Michael Hines and available on internet at:
  http://www.neuro.duke.edu/neuron/home.html

It contains mechanisms (.mod files) and programs (.hoc files) needed
to simulate the biophysical model, modified from the standard
Hodgkin-Huxley model, as described in the following submitted
manuscript

Arsiero, M., Luescher, H.-R., Lundstrom, B.N., and Giugliano,
M. (2007) The Impact of Input Fluctuations on the Frequency-Current
Relationships of Layer 5 Pyramidal Neurons in the Rat Medial
Prefrontal Cortex. sumbitted.

The paper examines in vitro frequency vs. current (f-I) relationships
of layer 5 (L5) pyramidal cells of the rat medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) using fluctuating stimuli. Studies in the somatosensory cortex
show that L5 neurons become insensitive to input fluctuations as input
mean increases and that their f-I response becomes linear. In
contrast, mPFC L5 pyramidal neurons retain an increased sensitivity to
input fluctuations, while their sensitivity to the input mean
diminishes to near zero.

A phenomenological approach, based on a novel Integrate-and-Fire model
is presented and employed to describe quantitatively the data and to
quantify the statistical significance of the new finding. An
underlying biophysical mechanism for the observed phenomenon is
proposed, based on a slow inactivating component of the sodium
current. The NEURON package provided here aims at giving the readers
the possibility of reproducing the simulations of the paper (Figure
4A), in the case of a standard Hodgkin-Huxley model (1952), modified
to include a slow inactivation component as described by Miles et
al. (2005).

The NEURON package thus include two new mechanisms: 1) a fluctuating
current-clamp injection, to mimick the experiments; 2) a modified
Hodgkin-Huxley model, including the additional gate variable. The gate
variable and its kinetics are from the contribution of Miles et al.,
(2005).

This model can be used to produce an ASCII text file (i.e. TF.x),
containing the mean firing rate for each combination of input current
mean and variance. A simple matlab script is then provided to plot
such results.

By opening the main simulation file 'runme.hoc' and modifying line 14
(i.e. the value of a_hhin) is possible to include or exclude the
additional slow inactivation of sodium channels

Questions on how to use this model should be addressed to Michele
Giugliano (mgiugliano@gmail.com)


Under unix systems:
===================
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui runme.hoc

Under Windows:
==============
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll DOS box&quot; and 
follow on-screen instructions.
A double click on the simulation file
runme.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

These model files were supplied by Marie-Therese Horstmann.

Usage:
------

Check that you have NEURON installed (available from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neuron.yale.edu&quot;&gt;http://www.neuron.yale.edu&lt;/a&gt;). Autolaunch from ModelDB **or** download
and extract the archive and compile the mod files to run under ...

linux/unix
----------
by typing
nrnivmodl
in the top level directory.  Then type
nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin
-------

Run mknrndll, cd to the expanded directory and press make nrnmech.dll
button.  Double click on the mosinit.hoc file.

MAC OS X
--------

Drag and drop the expanded folder onto mknrndll icon in the NEURON
application folder. Drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui
icon to start the simulation.

Once the simulation is running:
-------------------------------

Click the &quot;Run simulation/graph then write file&quot; button to recreate
figure 9A from the paper:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=125152&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\Uebachs-et-al_2010\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

The simulation takes 7 minutes on a linux 2.8GHz pentium 4. You can
check whether it's running or not by looking at the &quot;t&quot; parameter
which shows the current &quot;model time&quot;. You can stop the simulation by
the &quot;stop&quot; button. There is a 500ms pre-iteration period before the
current stimulation. The model needs this time to establish a steady
state. The membrane voltage trace from soma is written in a file
called &quot;outputdata.dat&quot; in the directory, where the model is
located. This is a plain ascii file. One data point corresponds to
0.25ms.  You can also, of course, change the model parameters varied
in the publication above.

This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:

Johnson MD and McIntyre CC. (2008) &quot;Quantifying the neural elements
activated and inhibited by globus pallidus deep brain stimulation.&quot; J
Neurophys.

Model files for two types of non-human primate neurons used in the
paper: simplified versions of 1) a GPi neuron and 2) a GPe axon
collateralizing in GPi en route to STN.  Additional files for
simulating the response of these cells to deep brain stimulation can
be requested by contacting the authors.

GPi neuron model (implemented from tracing in Fig4, Parent2001, J Comp
Neurol)

GPe axon model (implemented from tracing in Fig5, Sato2000 J Comp
Neurol)

Questions on the model, please contact Matt Johnson
(johnsom11@ccf.org)

Example Use:
------------

Check that you have NEURON installed (available from
http://www.neuron.yale.edu). Autolaunch from ModelDB **or** download
and expand the archive and compile the mod files to run under ...

linux/unix
----------
by typing
nrnivmodl GPi_model
in the top level (JohnsonMcIntyre2008) directory.  Then type
nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin
-------

Run mknrndll, cd to the expanded directory and then the GPi_model
subdirectory, press make nrnmech.dll button.  Move the nrnmech.dll
file to the top level directory (JohnsonMcIntyre2008).  Double click
on the mosinit.hoc file (in windows explorer).

MAC OS X
--------

Drag and drop the GPi_model directory onto the mknrndll icon.  Drag
and drop the GPi_hocProps.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.  This starts
the simulation for a point from fig 2C.

Once the simulation is running:
-------------------------------

Choose one of the first two buttons to either run a demo version
(short run) excerpt of figure 2A (right) or an example run from which
one point in the curve in figure 2C can be obtained.

For the later case (after 13 minutes on 2.8GHz Pent 4) you should see
an image that looks like this:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=114685&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\JohnsonMcIntyre2008\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

20110524 Ted Carnevale supplied an update for a likely almost never
occuring condition.  See mod files GPe_model/AXNODE75.mod
GPe_model/PARAK75.mod GPi_model/AXNODE75.mod GPe_model/PARAK75.mod for
lines on which a minus sign was removed.

   Cortical fast-spiking (FS) interneurons display highly variable electrophysiological properties. We hypothesize that this variability emerges naturally if one assumes a continuous distribution of properties in a small set of active channels. We construct a minimal, single-compartment conductance-based model of FS cells that includes transient Na+, delayed-rectifier K+, and slowly inactivating d-type K+ conductances. The model may display delay to firing. Stuttering (elliptic bursting) and subthreshold oscillations may be observed for small Na+ window current.Reference: Golomb D, Donner K, Shacham L, Shlosberg D, Amitai Y, Hansel D (2007) Mechanisms of Firing Patterns in Fast-Spiking Cortical Interneurons.  3:e156-

Running the model (execution of the mosinit.hoc file) will display
the data and simulation results as in  Fig 3 and 5.

The cell2 subdirectory contains cell data and simulation which shows
only a limited decrease in the action potential interval.
Running the model (cd cell2 and execute the mosinit.hoc file)
will display the data and simulation within a Multiple Run Fitter.

  HOW TO RUN
  ==========

Use autolaunch on modeldb or:

unix platform:

To compile the demo, NEURON and INTERVIEWS must be installed and working on
the machine you are using.  Just type &quot;nrnivmodl&quot; to compile the mechanisms
given in the mod files.

Then, execute the main demo program by typing:

  nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin platform:

  Compile the mechanism (mod) files by using mknrndll.  Then start the simulation
  by clicking on mosinit.hoc in windows explorer.

back to any platform:

Once the menu and graphics interface has appeared, select a simulation from the
&quot;Simulations of thalamic oscillations&quot; window.  Then click on &quot;Init and Run&quot;
button to start the simulation...

7/11/2005 Additional modifications to restart by first closing other simulation
windows and also updating README contact information.

2/14/2001 Michael Hines trivially modified some of the hoc files
to use the more flexible load_file in place of certain xopen statements,
ensure that the current version of the standard gui library comes
up first, and arrange graphs on the screen.

Not yet:
He also updated the mod files to be compatible with cvode and
make use of internal compuations of ionic reversal potential. This
version is quantitatively identical to the original.

10-2007: AD, better synaptic mechanisms using counters; added delta
oscillations.

   &quot;... We examined the relationship between dendritic arborization
and the coupling between somatic and dendritic action potential
(AP) initiation sites in layer 5 (L5) neocortical pyramidal neurons.
Coupling was defined as the relative reduction in threshold for
initiation of a dendritic calcium AP due to a coincident
back-propagating AP. Simulations based on reconstructions of
biocytin-filled cells showed that addition of oblique branches of the
main apical dendrite in close proximity to the soma (d &lt; 140 um)
increases the coupling between the apical and axosomatic AP initiation
zones, whereas incorporation of distal branches decreases
coupling. ... We conclude that variation in dendritic arborization may
be a key determinant of variability in coupling (49+-17%; range
19-83%; n = 37) and is likely to outweigh the contribution made by
variations in active membrane properties. Thus coincidence detection
of inputs arriving from different cortical layers is strongly
regulated by differences in dendritic arborization.&quot;

Model of Coincidence Detection in the Avian Brainstem, Neurocomputing 
26-27, 263-269 1999.

Abstract:
We have constructed a detailed biophysical model of coincidence
detector neurons in the nucleus laminaris (auditory brainstem) which are
purported to detect interaural time differences (ITDs). In the model, ITD
coding is improved when the inputs from both ears are located on the
bipolar dendrites and segregated, over having both inputs on the soma:
the model behaves like the in vivo coincidence detectors. The model has
enabled us to explore features of the coincidence detector neurons
unexplained by a simpler biophysical model (Agmon-Snir et al., Nature
393 (1998) 262}272), including the effect of synapse location and
multiple dendrites.

This simulation was tested/developed on LINUX systems, but may run on Microsoft Windows or Mac OS.

To run, you will need the NEURON simulator (available at http://www.neuron.yale.edu)

Unzip the contents of fdemo.zip to a new directory.

compile the mod files from the command line with:
 nrnivmodl *.mod

That will produce an architecture-dependent folder with a script called special.
On 64 bit systems the folder is x86_64. To run the simulation from the command line:
 ./x86_64/special
then NEURON will start and load the mechanisms (cell types, etc.)
then from the NEURON prompt:
 load_file(&quot;mosinit.hoc&quot;)

That will load the simulation and all required files. Network and inputs will be setup.
Then the simulation will be run for 20 seconds of simulation time. The simulation duration
is modifiable via the mytstop parameter in mosinit.hoc. Note that setup of the network may
take 10-30 seconds, depending on your processor speed, amount of RAM, and whether using
NetStim (usens flag in mosinit.hoc). Once the simulation has run, two graphs will be displayed,
showing the spike raster and LFP from a single column. The spike raster is arranged with y-axis
as cell identifier and x-axis as time in milliseconds. The y-axis is further arranged in order
of layer/type displayed with labels in the graph (top is layer 2, bottom is layer 6).

Once the spikes and LFP are displayed, the multiunit activity vectors for excitatory and inhibitory
cells are formed and their power spectra are calculated and displayed in separate plots for raw
(if the drawraw variable declared in mosinit.hoc is set to 1 before getpsd is called) and smoothed
power spectra. The red (blue) traces indicate power from excitatory (inhibitory) MUAs. The PSD smoothing
level is set by the boxszdef variable, and is normalized to the length of the simulation duration within
the getpsd function.

Note that the paper used Matlab's pmtm and fft functions which are only commercially available.
To allow use/test of this demo to the widest available audience, the NEURON spctrm Vector function
was used instead. Some differences in spectral output are visible depending on which spectral
methods are employed. See the getpsd function in mosinit.hoc for other options for spectral methods
that are freely available or contact samn at neurosim dot downstate dot edu for further information
and/or help using these other methods, including Matlab.

   &quot;Coordination of neocortical oscillations has been hypothesized to underlie the &amp;ldquo;binding&amp;rdquo; essential to cognitive function.

However, the mechanisms that generate neocortical oscillations in physiological frequency bands remain unknown.

We hypothesized that interlaminar relations in neocortex would provide multiple intermediate loops that would play particular roles in generating oscillations, adding different dynamics to the network.

We simulated networks from sensory neocortex using 9 columns of event-driven rule-based neurons wired according to anatomical data and driven with random white-noise synaptic inputs.

Running the kinetics.hoc simulation file will show 
the activation and inactivation steady-states, the time constants, 
and a family of curves generated modeling the same protocols 
used in the experiments for Figs.3A-3C of the paper.

According to this paper, the kinetic parameters change with
development. The values used in this model are those needed
to reproduce the experimental findings of Fig.3.

The time constants reported in the paper are shown
as markers of different color. 
Time constants in the range not covered by the paper
and activation kinetics have 
been adjusted to give a reasonable approximation of the
voltage-clamp current traces in Figs.3A-3C.

   In voltage-clamp experiments, incomplete space clamp distorts the recorded currents, rendering accurate analysis impossible. Here, we present
a simple numerical algorithm that corrects such distortions.  The method enabled accurate
retrieval of the local densities, kinetics, and density gradients of somatic and dendritic channels. The correction method was applied to two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings of K currents from the apical dendrite of layer 5 neocortical pyramidal
neurons. The generality and robustness of the algorithm make it a useful tool for voltage-clamp analysis of voltage-gated
currents in structures of any morphology that is amenable to the voltage-clamp technique.References: 1.

This is the readme.txt for the model associated with the paper:

Walther Akemann, Alicia Lundby, Hiroki Mutoh, Thomas Knopfel. Effect
of voltage sensitive fluorescent proteins on neuronal
excitability. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 3959-3976

These model files were contributed by Walther Akemann and Thomas
Knopfel.

The files contain the descriptor files for active conductances in a
monocompartment Purkinje cell model. Ion channel gating currents
(igate) are calculated from the first derivative of the state
dynamics.

Two voltage-sensitive fluorescent proteins, VSFP2.3 and VSFP3.1, are
modeled with a 8-state reaction (refered to as Model III in the paper)
to represent the sensing and fluorescence dynamics of these proteins.

To reproduce the simulations shown in Fig. 9 (left panel).  Simply
auto-launch from ModelDB (after NEURON is installed) or download and
extract the archive (a new folder is created), then compile the mod
files (and start) under

Linux:
------
by executing &quot;nrnivmodl&quot; in the expanded folder.  Then type 
&quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot;.

mswin:
------
by running mknrndll (select the new folder).  Then in Windows Explorer
double click on the mosinit.hoc file

MAC OS X:
---------
by dragging and dropping the new folder onto the mknrndll icon.  Drag
and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

Once the simulation has loaded:
-------------------------------
Press &quot;Start&quot;.  The simulation takes a little under 30 seconds on a
2.8 GhZ Pentium 4.  The simulations from the left panel of figure 9
appears:

   &quot;Fluorescent protein voltage sensors are recombinant proteins that are designed as genetically encoded cellular
probes of membrane potential using mechanisms of voltage-dependent modulation of fluorescence. 

Several such proteins,
including VSFP2.3 and VSFP3.1, were recently reported with reliable function in mammalian cells. 

...

Expression of these proteins in cell membranes is accompanied by additional dynamic membrane capacitance, ...

We used recordings of
sensing currents and fluorescence responses of VSFP2.3 and of VSFP3.1 to derive kinetic models of the voltage-dependent
signaling of these proteins. 

Using computational neuron simulations, we quantitatively investigated the perturbing effects of
sensing capacitance on the input/output relationship in two central neuron models, a cerebellar Purkinje and a layer 5 pyramidal
neuron. 
... &quot;.  The Purkinje cell model is included in ModelDB.Reference: Akemann W, Lundby A, Mutoh H, Knopfel T (2009) Effect of voltage sensitive fluorescent proteins on neuronal excitability.  96:3959-76

This simulation reproduces the morphologies and charging curves for 2 thalamocortical 
cells and 2 thalamic interneurons as in Fig. 1 of the above paper.

Note: parameters (Ra,Rm,Cm) are not the same as those shown in Fig. 1; instead the 
standard parameters from TABLE 2 are used

This simulation can be auto-launched from ModelDB or downloaded as a zip file.
After unzipping the simulation can be run by typing
nrngui mosinit.hoc
on PC or unix or by double clicking on the mosinit.hoc file on the PC.

scholl.hoc may be run from neuron main menu's &quot;load hoc&quot; or the oc command line:
oc&amp;gt;load_file(&quot;scholl.hoc&quot;)
which will plot Scholl(*) plots for these four cells (these plots show the 
number of processes from a cell that stradle each distance from the soma).

   Computer models were used to investigate passive properties of lateral geniculate nucleus thalamocortical cells and thalamic
interneurons based on in vitro whole-cell study. Two neurons of each type were characterized physiologically and morphologically.  Differences in the attenuation of propagated signals depend on both cell morphology and signal frequency.

   &lt;pre&gt;Readme for a model from the Quadroni and Knopfel 1994 paper:

Quadroni R, Knopfel T.
Compartmental models of type A and type B guinea pig medial vestibular neurons.
J Neurophysiol. 1994 Oct;72(4):1911-24.

    Institut fur Theoretische Physik, ETH-Honggerberg, Zurich, Switzerland.

Abstract:

1. We have developed compartmental models of guinea-pig medial
vestibular nuclei neurons (MVNns). The structure and the parameters of
the model cells were chosen to reproduce the responses of type A and
type B MVNns as described in electrophysiological recordings.
2. Dynamics of membrane potentials were modeled in 46 and 61 branched
electrical compartments for Type A and Type B MVNns,
respectively. Each compartment was allowed to contain up to nine
active ionic conductances: a fast inactivating sodium conductance,
gNa, a persistent sodium conductance, gNap, a low-voltage activated
calcium conductance, gCa(LVA), a high-voltage activated calcium
conductance, gCa(HVA), a fast-voltage activated potassium conductance,
gK(fast), a slowly relaxing voltage activated potassium conductance,
gK(slow), a fast transient potassium channel, gK(A), a slowly relaxing
mixed sodium-potassium conductance activating at hyperpolarized
membrane potentials, gH, and a calcium-activated potassium conductance
gK(AHP).  The kinetics of these conductances were derived from
voltage-clamp studies in a variety of preparations. Kinetic parameters
as well as distribution and density of ion channels were adjusted to
yield the reported electrophysiological behavior of medial vestibular
neurons.
3. Dynamics of intracellular free [Ca2]i were modeled by inclusion of
a Ca(2+)-pump and a Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger for extrusion of
calcium. Diffusion of calcium between submembraneous sites and the
center of an electrical compartment was modeled by 25 and 6 shell-like
chemical compartments for the cell body and the proximal dendrites,
respectively. These compartments also contained binding sites for
calcium.
4. The dynamics of active conductances were the same in both models
except for gK(fast). This was necessary to achieve the different shape
of spikes and of spike afterhyperpolarization in type A and type B
MVNns. An intermediate depolarizing component of the spike
afterhyperpolarization of type B neurons in part depended on their
dendritic cable structure.
5. Variation of the low threshold calcium conductance, gCa(LVA), shows
that the ability to generate low-threshold spike bursts critically
depends on the density of this conductance. Sodium plateaus were
generated when increasing the density of gNap.
6. The type B model cell generated rhythmic bursts of spiking activity
under simulation of two distinct experimental conditions.(ABSTRACT

-----------------------------------------
How to run the model:

Autolaunch from ModelDB and select figures by pressing a button or
download and expand the archive.  Then on

mswin: double click on the mosinit.hoc file after compiling the mod
     files with mknrndll

unix: type &quot;nrnivmodl&quot; and enter and then &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot; in the
     expanded archive folder.

mac: after the archive is unziped drag and drop the newly created mvns
     folder onto the mknrndll icon. Then drag and drop the mosinit.hoc
     in the mvns folder onto the nrngui icon.

-----------------------------------------

Note that the jpg file in this collection that shows the steady state
version of figure 3.  This figure differs slightly from the demo
because the demo doesn't reach a steady state before the currents are
displayed.  To get the same currents merely increase the simulation
length (tstop) to greater than 1000 ms and press init and run button.

Note that in the ca_X.mod files the K_ are converted into K2f_'s from
the paper by multiplying 2*FARADAY them (twice for the charge on Ca).
This effectively turns the formula's for the j_X fluxes (particles
passing boundaries) into formula's for i_X currents (coulombs per
second).

For questions about the paper please contact Thomas Knopfel, for
questions about the model code, Tom Morse.

20070912 Updated with extra dummy current in ca_*.mod files to
synchronize calculation of conductances with the currents.  Thanks to
Stephen Larson for the bug report and Michael Hines for the fix.

   The structure and the parameters of the model cells were chosen to reproduce the responses of type A and type B MVNns as described in electrophysiological recordings. The emergence of oscillatory firing under these two specific experimental conditions is consistent with electrophysiological recordings not used during construction of the model. We, therefore, suggest that these models have a high predictive value.Reference: Quadroni R, Knopfel T (1994) Compartmental models of type A and type B guinea pig medial vestibular neurons.  72:1911-24

Shah MM, Migliore M, Valencia I, Cooper EC, Brown DA (2008) Functional
significance of axonal Kv7 channels in hippocampal pyramidal
neurons. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 105(22):7869-7874

In this paper, the model confirmed the experimental findings
suggesting that axonal Kv7 channels are critically and uniquely
required for determining the inherent spontaneous firing of
hippocampal CA1 pyramids, independently of alterations in synaptic
activity.  This action was primarily due to modulation of action
potential threshold and membrane potential (RMP), amplified by control
of intrinsic axosomatic membrane properties.  The model predicts that
the axonal Kv7 density could be 3-5 times that at the soma.
The fig4a.hoc reproduces the traces shown in Fig.4a of the paper.

Under linux/unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui fig4a.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
fig4a.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Under MAC OS X:
to compile the mod files drag and drop the extracted folder onto the
mknrndll icon. Drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui
icon.

Once the model is running you can click on a button, for example,
fig. 4(ii) leads to:

This is an attempt to recreate a set of simulations originally
performed in 1994 under NEURON version 3 and last tested in 1999. When
I ran it now it did not behave exactly the same as previously which I
suspect is due to some minor mod file changes on my side rather than
due to any differences among versions. After playing around with the
parameters a little bit I was able to get something that looks
generally like a physiological trace in J Neurophysiol, 81:702--711,
1999, fig. 8b top trace:

   this is an attempt to recreate a set of simulations originally performed in 1994 under NEURON version 3 and last tested in 1999.  When I ran it now it did not behave exactly the same as previously which I suspect is due to some minor mod file changes on my side rather than due to any differences among versions.  

After playing around with the parameters a little bit I was able to get something that looks generally like a physiological trace in 
J Neurophysiol, 81:702--711, 1999, fig. 8b top trace. 

This sad preface is simply offered in order to encourage anyone who is interested in this model to make and post fixes.  I'm happy to help out.

   &lt;pre&gt;A Computational Model of Synaptic Transmission at the Calyx of Held
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This model allows the user to investigate faciliation and depression
in a complex Monte Carlo model of the calyx of Held, a giant synapse
in the mammalian auditory system.  It can be used to replicate the
results presented in the paper:

Bruce P. Graham, Adrian Y.C. Wong and Ian D. Forsythe, A computational
model of synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held, Neurcomputing
38-40: 37-42, 2001

The user is able to specify a presynaptic stimulation frequency and
duration.  The output is the postsynaptic current or voltage.

Main HOC file: run_epsc.hoc
---------------------------
Trains of EPSCs are produced that exhibit both facilitation and depression
(paper fig. 2). The relative contributions of these to the response can be
altered by changing the release probability (fig. 3).

Main HOC file: run_epsp.hoc
---------------------------
Same simulation as with &quot;run_epsc.hoc&quot;, but fast sodium and potassium
channels are added to the soma to produce a spiking response.  Output
is now the soma voltage trace.

   &lt;pre&gt;NEURON mod files for CaT currents from the paper:
McRory et al., J.Biol.Chem. 276:3999 (2001).

Running the kinetics.hoc simulation file will show 
the activation and inactivation steady-states and time constants
of the three members of the LVA calcium channels family studied
in this paper (alpha-1G, -1H, and -1I), with kinetic parameters 
from functional expression in transfected cells.

Parameters for activation/inactivation are from the paper.
However, not all the parameters used to fit (with single exponentials)
the experimental values for the time constants were given in the paper. 
Those explicitly reported were used to constrain a fit 
of experimental values derived from Fig.6.

Ca++ reversal potential is calculated from Nerst equation, using
internal and external Ca++ concentrations.
Default values are [Ca]i=50nM and [Ca]o=2mM.

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui kinetics.hoc

Under Windows:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
kinetics.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Questions on the model parameters should be directed to the 
authors of paper.

Questions on how to use this model with NEURON
should be directed to michele@pa.ibf.cnr.it

electroresponsiveness in cerebellar golgi

(2007) Fast-reset of pacemaking and theta-frequency resonance patterns
in cerebellar golgi cells: Simulations of their impact in
vivo. Front. Cell. Neurosci.

The cerebellar cortex input is profoundly influenced by the inhibitory
action of Golgi cells. Golgi cells display complex excitable
properties including (i) low-frequency pacemaking, (ii) adapting
high-frequency discharge during depolarization followed by AHP and
phase-reset, and (iii) sagging inward rectification during
hyperpolarization followed by rebound excitation (Forti et al.,
2006). An initial pharmacological analysis indicated that pacemaking
involved Ih, a persistent sodium current, an SK-type calcium-dependent
K+ current, and probably an M-like K+current. In order to assess
whether this set of currents was sufficient to explain pacemaking and
the other Golgi cell excitable properties, we have developed a
mathematical model. The above set of currents proved essential to
generate the salient Golgi cell responses. Moreover, the role of other
ion currents was predicted in order to obtain a proper quantitative
matching of specific properties. In particular, Ih maintained the cell
in the oscillatory regime, which was determined by the interplay of
INa-p with IK-slow and IK-AHP. Although IK-slow and IK-AHP are
redundant in the oscillatory process, IK-slow proved to be the most
effective for generating intrinsic resonance. Moreover, IK-A and
ICa-LVA are predicted to play an important role for regulating
response timing, and the ICa-VA/IK-Ca system to regulate spike
repolarization and high-frequency discharge. Our results suggest that
a complex complement of ionic mechanisms is needed to fine-tune
separate aspects of the neuronal response dynamics. Simulations also
suggest that the Golgi cell may exploit these mechanisms to obtain a
fine regulation of timing of incoming mossy fiber responses and
granular layer circuit oscillation and bursting.

Usage:

Auto-launch from ModelDB or download and extract the archive.  Then
under:

----
MSWIN

run mknrndll, cd to the archive and make the nrnmech.dll.  Then double
click on the mosinit.hoc file.

----
MAC OS X

Drag and drop the Golgi_cell folder onto the mknrndll icon.  Drag and
drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

----
Linux/Unix

Change directory to the Golgi_cell folder. run nrnivmodl. Then type
nrngui mosinit.hoc
----

Once the simulation is running press Init &amp; Run to generate a graph
similar to fig 2. from &quot;Computational reconstruction of pacemaking and
intrinsic electroresponsiveness in cerebellar golgi cells&quot;:

   &quot;Inward rectifying potassium (KIR) currents in medium spiny (MS) neurons of nucleus accumbens inactivate significantly in ~40% of the neurons but not in the rest, which may lead to differences in input processing by these two groups. 

Using a 189-compartment computational model of the MS neuron, we investigate the influence of this property using injected current as well as spatiotemporally distributed synaptic inputs. 

Our study demonstrates that KIR current inactivation facilitates depolarization, firing frequency and firing onset in these neurons. ...&quot;Reference: Steephen JE, Manchanda R (2009) Differences in biophysical properties of nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons emerging from inactivation of inward rectifying potassium currents.

Usage Notes:

To recreate Fig. 4: (will likely only run under unix); after
installing a version at least as recent as NEURON -- Release 6.1.1
(1894) 2007-11-24 (version displayed when you start nrngui) type the
following:

nrnivmodl
nrngui batch_.hoc

In under 2 minutes (on 2.8GHz Pentium 4) a display shows Expressor

This version recreates the connectivity matrix with different seeds
and is therefore not identical to the original (I was not being
careful with seeds at the time since I was storing the connectivity)

in addition to the graph, a panel is launched that allows you to look
at several other voltage traces that were recorded during the run

Patch clamp investigations and compartmental modeling of rod bipolar
axon terminals in an in vitro thin slice preparation of the mammalian
retina.  
J Neurophysiol 97: 1171-1187, 2007

Abstract:

To extend the usefulness of rod bipolar cells for studies of chemical
synaptic transmission, we have performed electrophysiological
recordings from rod bipolar axon terminals in an in vitro slice
preparation of the rat retina. Whole cell recordings from axon
terminals and cell bodies were used to investigate the passive
membrane properties of rod bipolar cells and analyzed with a
two-compartment equivalent electrical circuit model developed by
Mennerick et al. For both terminal- and soma-end recordings,
capacitive current decays were well fitted by biexponential
functions. Computer simulations of simplified models of rod bipolar
cells demonstrated that estimates of the capacitance of the axon
terminal compartment can depend critically on the recording location,
with terminal-end recordings giving the best estimates. Computer
simulations and whole cell recordings demonstrated that terminal-end
recordings can yield more accurate estimates of the peak amplitude and
kinetic properties of postsynaptic currents generated at the axon
terminals due to increased electrotonic filtering of these currents
when recorded at the soma. Finally, we present whole cell and
outside-out patch recordings from axon terminals with responses evoked
by GABA and glycine, spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents,
voltage-gated Ca2+ currents, and depolarization-evoked reciprocal
synaptic responses, verifying that the recorded axon terminals are
involved in normal pre- and postsynaptic relationships. These results
demonstrate that axon terminals of rod bipolar cells are directly
accessible to whole cell and outside-out patch recordings, extending
the usefulness of this preparation for detailed studies of pre- and
postsynaptic mechanisms of synaptic transmission in the CNS.

   &quot;Synfire chains have long been suggested as a substrate for perception and information processing in the nervous system. 

However, embedding activation chains in a densely connected nervous matrix risks spread of signal that will obscure or obliterate the message. 

We used computer modeling and physiological measurements in rat hippocampus to assess this problem of activity broadening.

We simulated a series of neural modules with feedforward propagation and random connectivity within each module and from one module to the next. ...&quot;Reference: Lytton WW, Orman R, Stewart M (2008) Broadening of activity with flow across neural structures.  37:401-7

transitions and entrainment to oscillations in a computational model
of the nucleus accumbens medium spiny projection neuron. J Neurosci
25(40): 9080-9095.

Abstract:

We describe a computational model of the principal cell in the nucleus
accumbens (NAcb), the medium spiny projection (MSP) neuron. The model
neuron, constructed in NEURON, includes all of the known ionic
currents in these cells and receives synaptic input from simulated
spike trains via NMDA, AMPA, and GABAA receptors. After tuning the
model by adjusting maximal current conductances in each compartment,
the model cell closely matched whole-cell recordings from an adult rat
NAcb slice preparation. Synaptic inputs in the range of 1000-1300 Hz
are required to maintain an &quot;up&quot; state in the model. Cell firing in
the model required concurrent depolarization of several dendritic
branches, which responded independently to afferent
input. Depolarization from action potentials traveled to the tips of
the dendritic branches and increased Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated
Ca2+ channels. As NMDA/AMPA current ratios were increased, the
membrane showed an increase in hysteresis of &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; state
dwell times, but intrinsic bistability was not observed. The number of
oscillatory inputs required to entrain the model cell was determined
to be approximately 20% of the &quot;up&quot; state inputs. Altering the
NMDA/AMPA ratio had a profound effect on processing of afferent input,
including the ability to entrain to oscillations in afferent input in
the theta range (4-12 Hz). These results suggest that afferent
information integration by the NAcb MSP cell may be compromised by
pathology in which the NMDA current is altered or modulated, as has
been proposed in both schizophrenia and addiction.

Usage:
1. Compile the mod files in the directory by invoking nrnivmodl
(unix/linux)or dragging the folder to mknrndll (Mac OS X), or running
mknrndll and changing directory to the expanded folder and making the
nrnmech.dll (mswin).

2. Run the model by typing &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot; (unix/linux), or
dropping mosinit.hoc on the nrngui (MAC OS X), or double clicking the
mosinit.hoc file (mswin).  The default run will be a current injection
evoking one action potential from the model.This reproduces a trace in
Fig 1D where the injected current=0.248 nA.  If you would like, you
can change the current to 0.271 nA in the PointProcessManager window
by selecting Show-&gt;Parameters and typing the new value under amp.  If
you select Keep Lines in the graph window and rerun, after changing
the color of the new trace to black you should get the following
graph:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=112834&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\nacb_msp\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

3. In order to generate an up and down state, turn on &quot;play netstims&quot;
at the bottom of the cell settings window.  Then hit init and run
again, and you should get the response to the preprogrammed afferent
input.  The window size should be reset to 2000 msec for this run:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=112834&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\nacb_msp\.\screenshot2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot2&quot; /&gt;

This model reproduces Figure 6a of the article 

&quot;Action potential generation requires a high sodium channel density in
the axon initial segment&quot;. Nature Neuroscience 11(2):178-86
(2008). &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v11/n2/abs/nn2040.html&quot;&gt;
http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v11/n2/abs/nn2040.html&lt;/a&gt;

The example simulation shows that even with specific
voltage-dependence of axonal Na+ channels a channel density of
~50-fold higher is required for robust initiation in the AIS.

The voltage-dependence of activation and inactivation of the Na+
channels are constrained by the experimentally measured properties of
the somato-dendritic (SD) and axon initial segment (AIS) Na+
channels. These two populations are defined within the &quot;na.mod&quot; and
&quot;nax.mod&quot; files, respectively, and based on Hodgkin-Huxley
formalism. Details on the specific channel kinetics and properties can
be found in the Supplementary Information of the paper. The mod file
was obtained from Mainen and Sejnowski (1996).

When the folder is compiled using the mknrndll script the simulation
can be started with &quot;mosinit.hoc&quot;.

Compile the mod files by starting mknrndll, changing directory to the 
NN_kole folder and selecting to make the nrnmech.dll.  Double click on the
mosinit.hoc file in a windows explorer window.

Once the simulation is started:
-------------------------------

The morphology of the cell

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=114394&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\NN_kole\.\screenshot_morphology.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;channel denisties&quot; /&gt;

an instantaneous plot of the voltage as a function of distance
thoughout the cell, and other windows appear.

You can recreate figure 6a left from the publication by pressing Init &amp; Run
in the RunControl Box.  

Select &quot;Keep lines&quot; in the voltage graph (drag from empty box
in the upper left corner and release mouse button on this menu item),
and, optionally, select to change the v(0.5) trace to a black dotted
line (use the Color/Brush menu item on the previous menu list, select
a black line and a dotted line and then click on the v(.5) text on the
graph).

Then changing the channel density by typing the new values into the
box:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=114394&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\NN_kole\.\screenshot_adjust.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;channel denisties&quot; /&gt;

and then press Init &amp; Run again.  Repeat with the remaining value
(simulation starts with 3000 so you will have to run with 4000 and
2000.  When done the graph should look like:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=114394&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\NN_kole\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;channel denisties&quot; /&gt;

   In this simulation action potential initiation, action potential properties and the role of axon initial segment Na+ channels are investigated in a realistic model of a layer 5 pyramidal neuron axon initial segment. The main Na+ channel properties were constrained by experimental data and the axon initial segment was reconstructed. Model parameters were constrained by direct recordings at the axon initial segment.Reference: Kole MH, Ilschner SU, Kampa BM, Williams SR, Ruben PC, Stuart GJ (2008) Action potential generation requires a high sodium channel density in the axon initial segment.  11:178-86

Rudolph M, Destexhe A (2005) An extended analytic expression for the
membrane potential distribution of conductance-based synaptic
noise. Neural Comput 17:2301-15

Abstract:

Synaptically generated subthreshold membrane potential (Vm)
fluctuations can be characterized within the framework of stochastic
calculus. It is possible to obtain analytic expressions for the
steady-state Vm distribution, even in the case of conductance-based
synaptic currents. However, as we show here, the analytic expressions
obtained may substantially deviate from numerical solutions if the
stochastic membrane equations are solved exclusively based on
expectation values of differentials of the stochastic variables, hence
neglecting the spectral properties of the underlying stochastic
processes. We suggest a simple solution that corrects these
deviations, leading to extended analytic expressions of the Vm
distribution valid for a parameter regime that covers several orders
of magnitude around physiologically realistic values. These extended
expressions should enable finer characterization of the stochasticity
of synaptic currents by analyzing experimentally recorded Vm
distributions and may be applicable to other classes of stochastic
processes as well.

Grunditz A, Holbro N, Tian L, Zuo Y and Oertner TG
Spine neck plasticity controls postsynaptic calcium signals through
electrical compartmentalization
J Neuroscience (2008) 28: 13457-13466

This model was set up to dissect the relative contribution of
different channels to the spine calcium transients measured at single
spines.  Our model spine is equipped with NMDA and AMPA receptors and
R-type calium channels.  Channel densities and spine neck resistance
(Rneck) were adjusted to reproduce the relative amplitude of
fluorescence transients measured in our pharmacological experiments

How to run the model Under Windows:  
1)download archive from ModelDB and expand the zip file 
2) compile the mod files with mknrndll 
3) start the program by double clicking the mosinit.hoc file

then you will hopefully see a 4 graphs plotting:
1) the EPSP at the soma
2) the EPSP at the spine head
3) the concentration calcium (bound to dye molecules) in the spine
   head
4) the current though the three channels (AMPARs, NMDARs and R-type
   channels) similar to the simulations in figure 4 of the paper

Comments:

Morphology of our CA1 pyramidal cell: we used the multi-compartment
model of a CA1 pyramidal cell from the NEURON database published in

Golding NL, Kath WL, Spruston N  
Dichotomy of action-potential backpropagation in CA1 pyramidal neuron
dendrites
J Neurophysiol (2001) 86: 2998-3010.

The model was simplified by removing all active conductances from the
soma and dendrites. We set membrane time constant (tm) to 28 ms,
giving Rm = 28 kOcm2 and Cm = 1µF/cm2. An intracellular resistivity of
Ri = 150 Ocm , and a membrane resting potential of Vrest = -65 mV were
used.

Three types of channels were implemented in the spine compartment,
namely NMDA, AMPA, and R-type voltage gated calcium channels.

The voltage-dependent R-type calcium conductance was simulated using
Hodgkin-Huxley like equation adapted from

Foehring RC, Mermelstein PG, Song WJ, Ulrich S, Surmeier DJ Unique
properties of R-type calcium currents in neocortical and neostriatal
neurons J Neurophysiol (2000) 84:2225-2236.

The kinetic equations for the AMPA and NMDA mechanism were taken from

Franks KM, Bartol TM, Jr., Sejnowski TJ A Monte Carlo model reveals
independent signaling at central glutamatergic synapses Biophysical
Journal 2002 83:2333-2348.

Note: The NMDA current was calculated in three steps: 

First as an non specific ion current though the NMDA receptor
Second the calcium current through the NMDA receptors was calculated
Third a balance current thorough the NMDA receptors was substracted
from the total current through the NMDA receptors

To model accumulation and diffusion of calcium-bound dye, we used a
mechanism taken from the NERUON database, that simulates radial
diffusion between concentric shells inside a compartment and
longitudinal diffusion between adjacent compartments. The diffusion
mechanism was inserted to the spine, spine neck, and connected
dendritic compartments (D = 0.23 µm2/ms, diffusion coefficient of
fluo5F-Ca2+ in cytoplasm).

Abstract:

We review different aspects of the simulation of spiking neural
networks.  We start by reviewing the different types of simulation
strategies and algorithms that are currently implemented.  We next
review the precision of those simulation strategies, in particular
in cases where plasticity depends on the exact timing of the
spikes.  We overview different simulators and simulation
environments presently available (restricted to those freely
available, open source and documented).  For each simulation tool,
its advantages and pitfalls are reviewed, with an aim to allow the
reader to identify which simulator is appropriate for a given task.
Finally, we provide a series of benchmark simulations of different
types of networks of spiking neurons, including Hodgkin-Huxley
type, integrate-and-fire models, interacting with current-based or
conductance-based synapses, using clock-driven or event-driven
integration strategies.  The same set of models are implemented on
the different simulators, and the codes are made available.  The
ultimate goal of this review is to provide a resource to facilitate
identifying the appropriate integration strategy and simulation
tool to use for a given modeling problem related to spiking neural
networks.


The codes included in this package refer to the benchmark
simulations described above.  The main goal is to provide a series
of benchmark simulations of networks of spiking neurons, and how
these are implemented in the different simulators overviewed in the
paper.  See details in the enclosed file Appendix2.pdf, which
describes these different benchmarks.  Some of these benchmarks
were based on the Vogels-Abbott model (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/25/46/10786&quot;&gt;Vogels TP and Abbott LF.

  <description>
   This package provides a series of codes that simulate networks of spiking neurons (excitatory and inhibitory, integrate-and-fire or Hodgkin-Huxley type, current-based or conductance-based synapses; some of them are event-based).  The same networks are implemented in different simulators (NEURON, GENESIS, NEST, NCS, CSIM, XPP, SPLIT, MVAspike; there is also a couple of implementations in SciLab and C++).
The codes included in this package are benchmark simulations; see
the associated review paper Brette et al. (2007) available at this link http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio.NC/0611089 The 
main goal is to provide a series of benchmark simulations of
networks of spiking neurons, and demonstrate how these are implemented in the
different simulators overviewed in the paper.  See also details in the
enclosed file Appendix2.pdf, which describes these different 
benchmarks.  Some of these benchmarks were based on the 
Vogels-Abbott model (Vogels TP and Abbott LF 2005).

Following is a brief overview of the contents of this directory:

(1) lib: 		This directory contains all the library functions called
			in the setup of the CA1 model cell as well as functions used in
			the experiments. Each of the functions is described in detail
			within the respective *.hoc file. 

(2) morphology: 	This directory contains the morphology of the cell
			as well as various lists of dendritic compartments used in the
			model setup and the experiments (files are in subdirectory n123).

			in the aforementioned publications. Within each subdirectory, the 
			*.hoc files contain the NEURON code for the experiment while the 
			run_* files are the executables used by the user to run the experiment. 
			Each experiment is described in detail in the respective .hoc files. Briefly:
			
			

tune-synapses		%%%% Code for tuning the AMPA/NMDA conductances of a synapse placed on any possible location
			%%%% of the cell such that a local single pulse stimulation will result in 5mV local depolarization
			%%%% For tuning, the NMDA conductance for each position is calculated using the NMDA/AMPA ratio 
			%%%% parameter provided by the user in /morphology/n123/nmda-ampa-ratio.hoc

spike-train-attennuation
			%%%% Code for (1) Backpropagating Action Potential generation (bpap.hoc) with somatic or dendritic 
			%%%% stimulation and (2) somatic/dendritic single trace generation under control, A-current blockade and
			%%%% Ca++ current blockade (Hofman_traces.hoc). The aim of this experiment is (1) to ensure that BPAPs 
			%%%% behave similarly to biophysical data that differentiate between somatic and dendritic stimulation 
			%%%% as seen in Spruston et al, 1995 and Golding eta al 1999. (2) to ensure that cell response to

Within each experiment directory, the *.hoc files contain the code to be executed and the respective run* files are the executables.
The user need to turn these files into executables by using the command:

chmod +x run_Afreq

on a unix/linux prompt, in the specific experiment directory. Then to run the experiments the user needs to
type the run* file name on the unix promt and assuming the NEURON path is set correctly in his/her .bashrc file
the experiments should start running.

!!!Clarification change!!!: The conductance value for the h current has been scaled by a factor of 1000 in cell-setup.hoc in order to eliminate this scaling 
factor from the h.mod file and correct the reported value which appeared to be very high in the Online Supplement. This does not alter the current in the 
model at all. The correction is in the reported conductance value which becomes 0.1872 mS/cm^2 and not 18.72 mS/cm^2 as was reported in the Online Supplement.


!!! Bug Report !!!  There was a typo in the nap.mod file pointed out by Michele Migliore which has now been corrected. It did not appear to have any significant 
effect on the model behavior and results.



If you have any problems using the model, please feel free to
contact me at poirazi@imbb.forth.gr.

Hope this is helpful! Good luck,

-------
6/22/2004 Version: In addition to the above bug report, these files were modified to run on mswin and 
updated to work with the very most recent (alpha version) of NEURON (request a replacement mos2nrn1.sh if you
want to autolaunch this model on mswin or install the alpha version
ftp://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/versions/alpha/nrn5.7.10setup.exe
available from neuron web site.)
If you have an earlier 5.x version of neuron on mswin you can use these files by 
by cd'ing to the mechanisms directory and compiling the mod files there and then starting up 
mosinit.hoc in the mechanisms directory (double clicking in mswin).

  <description>
   We developed a CA1
pyramidal cell model calibrated with a broad spectrum of in vitro data. Using simultaneous
dendritic and somatic recordings, and combining results for two different response measures
(peak vs. mean EPSP), two different stimulus formats (single shock vs. 50 Hz trains),
and two different spatial integration conditions (within vs. between-branch summation),
we found the cell's subthreshold responses to paired inputs are best described as a sum of
nonlinear subunit responses, where the subunits correspond to different dendritic branches.
In addition to suggesting a new type of experiment and providing testable predictions, our
model shows how conclusions regarding synaptic arithmetic can be influenced by an array
of seemingly innocuous experimental design choices.References: 1. Poirazi P, Brannon T, Mel BW (2003a) Arithmetic of subthreshold synaptic summation in a model CA1 pyramidal cell.  37:977-9872.

   &lt;pre&gt;NEURON mod files from the paper:
N. Poolos, M. Migliore, and D. Johnston
Pharmacological upregulation of h-channels selectively reduces
the excitability of pyramidal neuron dendrites
Nature Neuroscience 5, 767-774 (2002).

The paper shows that the anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine
shifts the I-h activation curve, and results in reduction of EPSPs summation
on distal dendrites while minimally influencing summation of proximal ones.
Rather than reproduce the main modeling figure of the paper (Fig.6)
with rather long simulations, the main effect is demonstrated here
with simpler and shorter simulations, where a single synapse
is randomly (poisson) activated at an average frequency of 20Hz.
With the lamotrigine.hoc file two simulations can be run:
- distal, where the synapse is at 200um from soma
- proximal, where the synapse is close to the soma.
In each case two traces will be superimposed, corresponding to
simulations with or without a +10mV shift  
in the Ih activation curve, modeling lamotrigine application.

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui lamotrigine.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
lamotrigine.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Questions on how to use this model
should be directed to michele.migliore@pa.ibf.cnr.it

Bugs and fixes:
03 July 2003  -  M. Migliore
A bug in the vhalfl variable declaration in h.mod
required a change of ghd in lamotrigine.hoc (from 0.0003 to 0.0006) 
to obtain the same results.

study.  Nat Neurosci. 2007 Feb;10(2):206-214.

The simulation code was supplied by Alon Polsky.

The simulation demonstrates initiation of a dendritic spike by current
injection from the 'dsyn' point process (double exponential
current injection source) located 45um from the soma and
backpropagation of action potential from somatic current injection.

The simulation includes a linearcircuit mechanism that simulates the
filtration imposed thin dendritic electrodes. Effects of different
levels of filtration can be examined by clicking on 'parameters'
button on the LinearCircuit[0] panel.

When run (click Init &amp; Run), the simulation automatically(*) executes
the simulation of a dendritic spike for a constant dendritic sodium
distribution presented at figure 6 of the paper.

To run the simulation of backpropagation of action potential set the
gmax of dsyn to zero and set the amp of IClamp to 3nA.  You can do
this in the point process window which is already open.

Example run:

Auto-launch from ModelDB and press enter to start the simulation or
download and extract the archive which will create a folder of files.
Compile the mod files and start under

Linux
-----
by cd'ing to the folder and then typing nrnivmodl, and then nrngui
mosinit.hoc

Mac OS X
--------
by dragging and dropping the folder on the makenrndll icon, and then
dragging and dropping the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

mswin
-----
by running mknrndll and cd'ing to the folder, and click on make
nrnmech.dll.  Finally double click on the mosinit.hoc file in windows
explorer.

Once the simulation is started
------------------------------

Click the Init &amp; Run button to generate the following graph similar to
the constant distribution of Na+ current in figure 6c:

   Dentate gyrus granule cells highly express the beta4 accessory subunit which confer BK channels with type II properties. The properties of heterologously-expressed BK channels (with and without the beta4 subunit) were used to construct channel models. These were then used to study how they affect single action potentials and trains of spikes in a model dentate gyrus granule cells (based on Aradi and Holmes, 1999).Reference: Jaffe DB, Wang B, Brenner R (2011) Shaping of action potentials by type I and type II large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels.

=====
USAGE
=====

You may either autolaunch from your browser, or download 
the zip file and run the simulations manually.


1.  Autolaunching from ModelDB
------------------------------

A &quot;Launch&quot; panel will appear that offers four buttons labeled
  Ring (Serial)
  Ring (Parallel)
  Random (Serial)
  Random (Parallel)
Click on one of these to run a simulation.  Results will be 
printed in the terminal window.  At the end of a run, you may 
run another simulation, or exit.


2.  Download zip file
---------------------

Expand the zip file in an empty directory.
The ring and random network files are in 
  HinesCarnevaleJNM2007/ring
and
  HinesCarnevaleJNM2007/random
respectively.

Before running the random network simulations, you must first 
compile the mod files in HinesCarnevaleJNM2007/random with mknrndll 
(MSWin, OS X) or nrnivmodl (UNIX/Linux).
If you're not sure how, see
http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/docs/faq.html#compilemod

To run a simulation manually:

UNIX/Linux--
cd into the ring or random subdirectory
At the system prompt, type
  nrngui filename
where filename is one of the following:
  ringser.hoc
  ringpar.hoc
  ran3ser.hoc
  ran3par.hoc

MSWin--
Double click on ringser.hoc, ringpar.hoc, ran3ser.hoc, or 
ran3par.hoc
If the simulation finishes and exits too quickly, open the 
hoc file with a plain text editor and change the last 
statement from 
  quit()
to
// quit()
Save the hoc file and try again.  It will now be necessary 
to type ^D (control-D) or quit() at the oc&amp;gt; prompt to exit 
NEURON.

OS X--
Double click on ringser.hoc, ringpar.hoc, ran3ser.hoc, or 
ran3par.hoc
  or
drag and drop the hoc file on the nrngui icon in the NEURON 
application folder.
If the simulation finishes and exits too quickly, edit the 
hoc file as suggested for MSWin.

The following simulations work well in NEURON 6.2.  They do NOT work
well in NEURON 5.6 and NEURON 5.8.  Other versions of NEURON have not
been tested.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


	Setup (assuming Windows):

Either auto-launch from ModelDB and click buttons or:

- Unzip AckerAnticBasalBackprop.zip.

- Upon extraction of the zipped files, membrane mechanisms and
morphology files reside in a separate directory called &quot;Model&quot;.

- Compile the .mod files using the NEURON &quot;mknrndll&quot; command in the
&quot;Model&quot; directory. Make sure that mod files are compiled in the
&quot;Model&quot; directory.  If compiling was successful each mod file in the
Model directory must be accompanied by one .o file.

- Move the .dll file (nrnmech.dll) from the &quot;Model&quot; directory to the
directory where you unpacked the files; the directory that includes
AckerAnticBasalBackprop.hoc.

- Go to the directory that includes AckerAnticBasalBackprop.hoc.

- Double click on AckerAnticBasalBackprop.hoc. This will open 7
windows including the nrniv command console.

	REPRODUCING FIGURE 6B.

- To reproduce Fig. 6B use GUI (Best fit model). Hit RUN button. Wait
until the model finishes three sets of simulations (BLACK, RED, and
GREEN).

	BLACK = Control with all currents intact.
	RED = Block of sodium current with TTX. 
	GREEN = Block of A-type current with 4-AP.

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=117207&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\acker_antic\.\screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

- Graph[0] plots the AP waveforms in the soma.

- Graph[1] plots the AP waveforms in the basal dendrite (indicated by
asterisk in Figure 6A).

Graph[2] has a dual function. 

(1)During the simulation Graph[2] is a space plot of AP waveforms
along all basal dendrites considered in the model (BLACK motion).

(2)At the end of the entire set of experiments (CTR, TTX and 4-AP)
Graph[2] plots peak AP amplitudes along all basal dendrites considered
in the model (multiple locations). Each line corresponds to one basal
dendrite. Each dendrite is analyzed in three conditions (CONTROL, TTX
and 4-AP) and therefore each dendrite is represented with three lines
at the end of simulations (BLACK, RED and GREEN).

- Note: Duration is set to 15 ms. This can be changed in a hoc file by
changing tstop variable.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


	TRIPLETS - REPRODUCING FIGURES 8B-2 and 10C


- Double click on Triplets.hoc. This will open 9 windows.


	REPRODUCING FIGURE 8B-2

- Click &quot;Run best fit model (Figure 8B)&quot;.

- Graph[0] plots the AP waveforms in the soma (black) superimposed
with the AP waveforms in the dendritic segment marked &quot;dend-1&quot; in
Fig. 8B-1 (red).

- Graph[1] plots three current pulses delivered into the soma to
trigger 3 APs.

- Graph[2] plots the AP waveforms in the basal dendrite location
indicated by asterisk in Figure 8B-1.


	REPRODUCING FIGURE 10C 

- Run special case dendrite (Figure 10C).

- Same graphs, same recording locations, as in the previous exercise. 
	
- Note that only one basal dendrite (Graph[2]) was endowed with
special case properties. The output from this dendrite is displayed in
Figure 10C - Right. Basal dendrite shown in Graph[0](red) is
&quot;Typical&quot;, best fit model dendrite.

- Fig. 10C used 5 ms inter-stimulus interval rather than 8 ms, which
gives &quot;smooth&quot; boosting of second and third action potentials,
otherwise all the amplitude boosting appears in the second action
potential and no further boosting appears in the third.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


	LOCAL SPIKE SIMULATIONS (FIGURES 9 and 10) 
	

- Double click on LocalSpikes.hoc. This will open 10 windows.

- Graph[3] plots the membrane potential waveform in the soma.

- Graph[0] plots the membrane potential waveform in the basal dendrite
location indicated by BLUE circle in PointProcessManager, but also the
same location is indicated by circle in Fig. 9A.

- Graph[2] plots the conductance change (G) applied to the dendritic
segment under study.

- Graph[1] plots the local transmembrane current (I) caused by plateau
conductance change.

- Click buttons in GUIs corresponding to specified figures to reproduce them.

- &quot;Blocking IA&quot; in these simulations only sets the proximal or
perisomatic IA conductance to zero, however, the distribution is
unchanged and the channel density therefore rises from zero with a
slope of 0.7 pS/um2 per micrometer.

- According to the first derivative of the somatic voltage waveform
(dV/dt) the branch strength potentiation was successful only in the
model basal dendrite with special properties. These special properties
included higher sodium conductance and higher A-type conductance
(Special Case Dendrite A-Type Block).

  <description>
   &quot;.. We
carried out multi-site voltage-sensitive dye imaging of membrane potential transients from thin basal
branches of prefrontal cortical pyramidal neurons before and after application of channel blockers. We
found that backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) are predominantly controlled by voltage-gated
sodium and A-type potassium channels. In contrast, pharmacologically blocking the delayed rectifier
potassium, voltage-gated calcium or Ih, conductance had little effect on dendritic action potential
propagation. Optically recorded bAP waveforms were quantified and multicompartmental modeling
(NEURON) was used to link the observed behavior with the underlying biophysical properties. The
best-fit model included a non-uniform sodium channel distribution with decreasing conductance with
distance from the soma, together with a non-uniform (increasing) A-type potassium conductance. AP
amplitudes decline with distance in this model, but to a lesser extent than previously thought. We used
this model to explore the mechanisms underlying two sets of published data involving high frequency
trains of action potentials, and the local generation of sodium spikelets. ...&quot;Reference: Acker CD, Antic SD (2009) Quantitative Assessment of the Distributions of Membrane Conductances Involved in Action Potential Backpropagation Along Basal Dendrites.  101:1524-1541

in detecting the excitatory and the inhibitory components of the
synaptic drive.

TO RUN THE SIMULATION
(First auto-launch from ModelDB, or download and extract the archive
and then compile the mod files with nrnivmodl (unix), mknrndll
(mswin), or drag and dropping archive folder onto mknrndll (mac)).
To run the simulation press the &quot;run&quot; button on the control panel.
To change the excitatory synaptic conductances set the &quot;AMPA&quot; and the

Baranauskas G,Martina M (2006) Sodium Currents Activate without a
Hodgkin and Huxley- Type Delay in Central Mammalian Neurons
J. Neurosci. 26(2):671-684

Abstract:
Hodgkin and Huxley established that sodium currents in the squid giant
axons activate after a delay, which is explained by the model of a
channel with three identical independent gates that all have to open
before the channel can pass current (the HH model). It is assumed that
this model can adequately describe the sodium current activation time
course in all mammalian central neurons, although there is no
experimental evidence to support such a conjecture. We performed high
temporal resolution studies of sodium currents gating in three types
of central neurons. The results show that, within the tested voltage
range from -55 to -35 mV, in all of these neurons, the activation time
course of the current could be fit, after a brief delay, with a
monoexponential function. The duration of delay from the start of the
voltage command to the start of the extrapolated monoexponential fit
was much smaller than predicted by the HH model. For example, in
prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons, at -46 mV and 12 degrees C, the
observed average delay was 140 micros versus the 740 micros predicted
by the two-gate HH model and the 1180 micros predicted by the
three-gate HH model. These results can be explained by a model with
two closed states and one open state. In this model, the transition
between two closed states is approximately five times faster than the
transition between the second closed state and the open state. This
model captures all major properties of the sodium current
activation. In addition, the proposed model reproduces the observed
action potential shape more accurately than the traditional HH model.

The model files were supplied by
Gytis Baranauskas &amp;lt;baranauskas@elet.polimi.it&amp;gt;

A demo is provided that produces the voltage clamp currents for the
6-state Na channel with the protocol from figure 5C.

To run the model:  simply auto-launch from ModelDB (after
NEURON is installed) or

download and expand the archive.  Compile the mod files by
running nrnivmodl (unix) or mknrndll (mswin), or (mac) drag the 
na2006 folder onto the mknrndll icon in the NEURON application 
folder. 

Start the simulation by double clicking on mosinit.hoc (mswin)
or typing &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot; (unix), or dragging either the
mosinit.hoc or the vc_demo.hoc file to the nrngui (mac) icon in
the NEURON application folder.

Additional notes from Gytis Baranauskas:

The A-type current and slow outward potassium current were 
taken from NEURON ModelDB database, Migliore model based 
on Sakmann &amp; Korngreen paper, the only modifications were 
shift by +4 mV of voltage dependence of kslow that made 
easier selection of the parameters.

Included are two additional model files kdersej and nachansej 
that were used during current clamp simulations. They are 
based on the published model of Mainen, ZF, J Joerges, et 
al. (1995) A model of spike initiation in neocortical 
pyramidal neurons. Neuron 15(6): 1427-39.

The remaining data (current densities, current injection 
parameters, modifications of pyramidal demo model soma 
size, temperature) were inserted manually in the Demo mode 
of the NEURON employing the provided GUI, for me it was 
the easiest way.

Note: this version contains temperature dependence in all the
channels.

   &lt;pre&gt;This model package provides NEURON codes for a multi-compartment model described 
in Zhou Y, Carney LH, Colburn HS (2005). The model simulates recent physiological 
results from the gerbil medial superior olive (MSO) that reveal that blocking 
glycinergic inhibition can shift the tuning for the interaural time difference (ITD)
of the cell (Brand et al., 2002). 

The model has a bipolar structure and incorporates two anatomic observations 
in the MSO: (1) the axon arises from the dendrite that receives ipsilateral 
inputs (Smith, 1995); and (2) inhibitory synapses are located primarily 
on the soma in adult animals. Specific Hodgkin-Huxley type of ionic channels 
are inserted into the axon to generate action potentials: fast sodium (Ina), 
low threshold potassium (ILTK), high threshold potassium (IHTK), 
hyperpolarization-active inward current (Ih), and the leakage channel (Il). 

The kinetics of all channels are based on the model of Type II cells in the 
anteroventral cochlear nuclei (Rothman and Manis, 2003c). The soma has only 
fast sodium channels. Ionic channels and the driving function for synaptic 
inputs are described in .mod files. The hoc files describe simulation procedures 
for modeling neural responses to ITDs (MSO_Zhouetal_2005.hoc) and a test kit 
for exploring input characteristics (test_inputs.hoc). Use NEURON command nrnivmodl 
to compile *.mod files, and then execute a *.hoc file. Please refer to NEURON 
documentations for further instructions on compiling mod files and 
launching hoc files on different operation systems.  

The file MSO_Zhouetal_2005.hoc produces the rate-ITD responses 
in Figures. 5, 6, 8, 11 in Zhou Y, Carney LH, Colburn HS (2005). 

Go to http://www.bu.edu/dbin/binaural/MSOdemo for more instructions on using the model. 

Any questions for implementing the model should be directed to Yi Zhou (yizhou@bu.edu).

   This model simulates responses of neurons to interaural time difference (ITD) in the medial superior olive (MSO) of the mammalian brainstem. The model has a bipolar cell structure and incorporates two anatomic observations in the MSO: (1) the axon arises from the dendrite that receives ipsilateral inputs and (2) inhibitory synapses are located primarily on the soma in adult animals. Fine adjustment of the best ITD is achieved by the interplay of somatic sodium currents and synaptic inhibitory currents. The model suggests a mechanism for dynamically &quot;fine-tuning&quot; the ITD sensitivity of MSO cells by the opponency between depolarizing sodium currents and hyperpolarizing inhibitory currents.Reference: Zhou Y, Carney LH, Colburn HS (2005) A Model for Interaural Time Difference Sensitivity in the

Dopaminergic (DA) neuron model with a morphologicaly realistic
dendritic architecture. The model captures several salient features of
DA neurons under several pharmacological manipulations and exhibits
depolarization block for sufficiently high current pulses into the
soma.

The model refers to the paper:

Anna Y. Kuznetsova, Marco A. Huertas, Alexey S. Kuznetsov, Carlos
A. Paladini and Carmen C. Canavier (2010) Regulation of firing
frequency in a computational model of a midbrain dopaminergic neuron
J Comput Neurosci. 2010 Jun;28(3):389-403.

The files included here correspond to the morphologically realistic
reconstructed model (see Figure 1 in paper) and reproduce results
presented in the paper:
1) Fig2a2.hoc			Figure 2 (a2)
2) Fig2b2.hoc			Figure 2 (b2)
3) Fig2f2.hoc				Figure 2 (f2)
4) Fig6a_solid_trace            Figure 6a: solid line corresponding to
                                100 pA stimulation current
5) Fig6a_dashed-line_trace      Figure 6a: dashed line corresponding
                                to 500 pA stimulation current

The first three examples illustrate spontaneous firing of the model DA
neuron in control (1) and after blocking SK channel (2) and Na
channels (3).

Last two files show the response of the model DA neuron to simulated
current pulse to the soma for 100 pA (4) and 500 pA (5). In the last
case one can observe depolarization block.

You can run the simulation either by auto-launching from ModelDB, or
by first compiling the mechanisms as follows:

a) Under LINUX
	Type

	nrnivmodl

	Then type 

	nrngui mosinit.hoc

b) Under Windows

	Run mknrndll to compile the mod files in the top level
	directory.

c) Under MAC - OS X

	Drag and drop the archive file on the mknrndll icon (in the
	NEURON application folder).

------------------------------
If running the individual files listed above:
Once Neuron has been started on your platform select in the main manu
	Tools -&gt; RunControl
	Graph -&gt; Voltage axis
then select 
	File -&gt; load hoc
and choose the file you want to run. Finally press Init &amp; Run.
------------------------------

If auto-launched then press a button corresponding to the figure
desired and you can generate figures like these:

Journal of Physiology (2006). DOI:10.1113/jphysiol.2006.1139441

The subiculum.hoc file will run four 800ms simulations plotting the
membrane potential at the soma

The cell morphology is the one illustrated in figure 6A (now with the
axon).  The morphology of this typical subiculum neuron is given in
the S40.hoc file

The simulation produces part of the data illustrated in figure 6D and
6E.

Regular and burst firing pyramidal neurons from the subiculum differ
in the levels of Ih. In the simulations a fraction of the AMPA
synapses distributed over the apical dendrites are simultaneously
activated at eiter 20 Hz or 50 Hz in both types of neurons. The
simulations support the experimental results from the paper,
illustrating that the different densities of Ih affect the summation
of the synaptic input when recorded from the soma.

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui subiculum.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
subiculum.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

  <description>
   Pyramidal neurons in the subiculum typically display either bursting
or regular-spiking behavior. ...  Here we report that bursting neurons
posses a hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) that is
two-fold larger (conductance: 5.3 ± 0.5 nS) than in regularspiking
neurons (2.2 ± 0.6 nS), while Ih exhibits similar voltage-dependent
and kinetic properties in both classes of neurons. Bursting and
regular-spiking neurons display similar morphology. The difference in
Ih between the two classes is not responsible for the distinct firing
patterns, since neither pharmacological blockade of Ih nor enhancement
of Ih using a dynamic clamp affects the qualitative firing
patterns. Instead, the difference in Ih between bursting and
regular-spiking neurons determines the temporal integration of evoked
synaptic input from the CA1 area. In response to 50 Hz stimulation,
bursting neurons, with a large Ih, show ~50% less temporal summation
than regular-spiking neurons.  ...  A computer simulation model of a
subicular neuron with the properties of either a bursting or a
regular-spiking neuron confirmed the pivotal role of Ih in temporal
integration of synaptic input. These data suggest that in the
subicular network, bursting neurons are better suited to discriminate
the content of high frequency input, such as that occurring during
gamma oscillations, compared to regular-spiking neurons.  See paper for more and details.

 Functional Characterization and Neuronal Modeling of the Effects of Childhood 
 Absence Epilepsy Variants of CACNA1H, a T-Type Calcium Channel

 The models for this paper were made by modifying Alain Destexhe's
 thalamic reticular neuron model: Destexhe A, Contreras D, Steriade M, 
 Sejnowski TJ and Huguenard JR.  In vivo, in vitro and computational 
 analysis of dendritic calcium currents in thalamic reticular neurons.
 Journal of Neuroscience 16: 169-185, 1996.

 Three representative models are present for Vitko et al: wild-type (WT) 
 recombinant Cav3.2 T-channel, and two of the mutants described in the 
 Vitko et al, 2005 paper (C456S and R788C).
 
 These file were provided by Perez-Reyes.
 
 The auto-launch demo starts with the C456S channel.  The other channels can be
 accessed by downloading the archive, compiling the mod files with nrnivmodl 
(unix) or mknrndll (mac and mswin) and then double clicking on the 
mosinit.hoc file.  See the below directories readme files for more usage
information.

Details to reproduce Fig 7:  The model will need to downloaded and compiled as
per the above paragraph so that the wildtype and R788C mutant directories can 
each be accessed.  Start with the mosinit.hoc in either directory. Run
the model in:
	Burst in 3 compartment Model
	Current clamp
	Location dend1[1][1]
	delay off
	and then either:
	fig Aa	EPSP:  0.02 nA current injection for 100 ms
	fig Ba	IPSP: -0.1  nA current injection for 300 ms

7/12/2004 models updated to run with button presses of control panel (had
to be restarted earlier).

   &quot; ... Although existing models of motoneurons have indicated the distributed role of certain conductances in
regulating firing, it is unclear how the spatial distribution of certain currents is ultimately shaping motoneuron output. 

Thus, it would be helpful to
build a bridge between histological and electrophysiological data. 

The present report is based on the construction of a 3D motoneuron model based
on available parameters applicable to the neonatal spinal cord. ...&quot;Reference: Ostroumov K (2007) A new stochastic tridimensional model of neonatal rat spinal motoneuron for investigating compartmentalization of neuronal conductances and their influence on firing.

nmda conductance can explain posttraumatic epileptogenesis without disinhibition: 
a model. Journal of Neurophysiology 82:1748-1758

After unzipping the archive and cd'ing to the directory:

To run under unix:  
        nrnivmodl; nrngui init.hoc
On the PC:
	While running mknrndll, cd to ctxnet and select make nrnmech.dll to compile
	the mod files in the ctxnet directory.
	Double click on mosinit.hoc in the ctxnet directory in window explorer
	
On the OS X mac:
	Drag the ctxnet folder to the mknrndll icon under the Neuron 5.7 application.
	When the above is complete drag the ctxnet folder to the nrngui icon.
	
Simulation shows epileptiform response to brief single stimulation in a 500 cell
network of multicompartment models, some of which have active dendrites.

The simulation depends on random number generation so will likely run differently
under different operating systems.  The results which I obtained under Redhat
Linux is shown in result.gif.  The current version can have a couple of lines 
uncommented in holt_random.mod (see comments) to have the seed change each 
time the simulation is run.

Original 1997 code from Paul Bush modified slightly by Bill Lytton to make it work with
current version of NEURON (5.7.139).  Thanks to Paul Bush and Ken Miller for
making the code available.

This is the README for a model associated with the paper:

Chapman JB, Johnson EA, Kootsey JM. (1983) Electrical and Biochemical
Properties of an Enzyme Model of the Sodium Pump 
J. Membrane Biol. 74, 139-153

This implementation was created by Michael Hines.

Generates figures 2-12. Fig 9 unidirectional fluxes were computed using
equations 13,14 from
Feher JJ, Biophys J. 1984 June; 45(6): 1125b
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1434995

The lines are not labeled but they are easy to
compare with the figures in the paper.

The mod file can be simplified by removing the calculation and storage
of the individual forward and reverse fluxes, i.e. rf[] and rb[].  For
use in a more complex model, this mod file should be modified with
USEION statements to use na and k ion concentrations and generate ina
and ik. The dynamic directory shows an example of this by extending
the Chapman et al simulations using nai, ki, and atp as states, which,
in the presence of leak channels for na, k and non-specific ions,
produce reasonable na and k gradients. See dynamic/README.

Usage:
Simply auto-launch from ModelDB or compile the mod files under

MSWIN:
-----

Use mknrndll (change directory to the one expanded from the archive
and click &quot;make nrnmech.dll&quot;).  Then run by double clicking the
mosinit.hoc file in a windows explorer.

MAC OS X
--------

Drag and drop the expanded folder from this archive onto the mknrndll
icon.  Drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

Linux/Unix
----------

Change directory to the expanded folder and type these two lines:
nrnivmodl
nrngui mosinit.hoc

Once the simulation is started
------------------------------

Simply press the buttons to reproduce figures.  For example pressing
the &quot;Figure 2-3&quot; button leads to:

   This classic model of ventricular myocardial fibres was implemented by Francois Gannier. &quot;... Four individual components of ionic current were formulated mathematically
in terms of Hodgkin-Huxley type equations. The model incorporates
two voltage- and time-dependent inward currents, the excitatory
inward sodium current, illa, and a secondary or slow inward current,
is, primarily carried by calcium ions. A time-independent outward
potassium current, iK1, exhibiting inward-going rectification, and a voltage-
and time-dependent outward current, i.1, primarily carried by potassium
ions, are further elements of the model....&quot;

   &lt;pre&gt;This NEURON implementation qualitatively reproduces the phenomena described in 
Chow, C.C. and White, J.A.
Spontaneous action potentials due to channel fluctuations.
Biophysical Journal 71:3013-3021, 1996

An exact reproduction of their figures is not possible for the following reasons:
--differences in the pseudorandom number generators
--differences in numerical integration methods
--differences in the algorithms used to govern channel state 
  transitions

If this doesn't auto-launch, use NEURON to load init.hoc

When first loaded, this code automatically emulates part of Figure 2.
With minor modifications, it can be used to generate data for Figures 1, 3, and 4; 
however, note that this will require prolonged, repeated simulations.

On a 2 GHz PC, ~1600 seconds are needed to simulate 30 seconds of activity 
in a 100 um2 patch of membrane.

NOTE: this relies on the ChannelBuilder's ability to simulate stochastic
channels, which requires NEURON v. 5.7 or later.

spike-and-wave seizures. J Neurophysiol, 77:1679-1696, 1997.
Fig 7 on p 1688  (jnphys77:1679.pdf)

Simulation of figure 7 may take several minutes. fig7.gif shows the output of
the simulation.

A phase plane analysis of a two cell interaction between a
thalamocortical neuron (TC) and a thalamic reticularis neuron (RE).
Figure legend : Analysis of spontaneous transition from mutual to
quiescent mode with bursting viewed in the RE T-channel m/h plane.
  A. RE neuron voltage trace (A1) and TC voltage trace (A2) shows 8
bursts of mutual activity followed by switch into the quiescent
state.  Color for each cycle give the key for the phase planes
below.  Interburst intervals are depicted in panel Ba.  Alternating
bursts are shown in panels Bb and Bc.  Initial oscillation appears
to be approximately period-2 with burst alternating with an
interburst depolarization.
  B. Apparent approximate period-2 oscillation illustrated to be
period-4: four cycles occur before the cycle repeats.  In each phase
plane, abscissa gives the value of mT (T channel activation),
ordinate the value of hT (T channel inactivation).  
Trajectories run counterclockwise.  Interbursts alternated
between large cycles (solid line type) and small cycles (dashed line type)
  Burst Bb
showed a progression of gradually increasing hT, while burst Bc
was more coherent and showed no regular shift.  The inner loop in Ba
gradually collapsed to terminate the oscillation.  The subsequent
interburst (grey dashed) was similar in extent to large cycle.
  C. Inner and outer interburst cycles seen in the voltage-calcium plane
corresponded to Ba-inner and Ba-outer respectively.  The collapse of the inner
cycle is not as clear as in Ba, however.  Trajectories run clockwise.

RE-RUN:
  simsim() allows you to simulate a simulation by graphing out the
    saved data slowly so that you can see the phase planes unfold in time
    (can be slowed down by setting disp_delay to a large number)

* notes
1) graphics box comes up with graphs set to &quot;New View&quot; to allow closer
inspection of phase planes
2) use 'vecpanel()' call to bring up interactive tool for generating
other graphics

J. Neurosci. 4: 803-811

The model semiquantitatively reproduces figures 2-6. Slight
discrepancies are due to the radial spatial discretization process. In
this model, the second order correct calcium concentrations are located at
i*100 angstroms from the cylindrical membrane. i.e. the 0th compartment
is membrane adjacent instead of at 50Angstroms and has half the volume
of other compartments. The NANN-1 th compartment contains the remainder of
the cell volume. Values for the pump magnitudes (ke in cm/sec) are multiplied
by the (1+beta) factor for consistency with the paper. It was not made clear
in the paper that although (1+beta) can be considered a scale factor for the
diffusion constant, in that interpretation it must also scale source and sink fluxes.
Apparently only the source flux was scaled.

The NEURON implementation of this model was prepared by Michael Hines.
Questions about details of this implementation should be addressed to him
at michael.hines@yale.edu.

   The diffusion of calcium is effectively reduced
by the ratio of bound to free calcium. Treating
the release magnitude as proportional to the
fourth power of calcium concentration next to
the membrane gives reasonable facilitation
with very little release between spikes.Reference: Stockbridge N, Moore JW (1984) Dynamics of intracellular calcium and its possible relationship to phasic transmitter release and facilitation at the frog neuromuscular junction. J Neurosci 4:803-11

   Using a previous model of respiratory rhythm generation, we modified the network architecture such that cells can be segregated into two clusters. Cells within a given cluster burst with smaller phase differences than do cells from different clusters. This may explain the large phase differences seen experimentally, as reported in the paper.Reference: Fietkiewicz C, Loparo KA, Wilson CG (2011) Drive latencies in hypoglossal motoneurons indicate developmental change in the brainstem respiratory network.  8:065011-

   &lt;pre&gt;NEURON and MATLAB code for simulations and data analysis are divided
among four folders, each of which contains its own README file. Each
folder contains files for reproducing graphs from one of the Figures
in Welday et. al.:

1) The 'Welday_et_al_Fig1' folder contains MATLAB data analysis code
that was used to generate DBFT curves from spike trains of recorded
theta cells. The raw spike and position data for the real data example
cell (shown in Fig. 1) are also provided.

2) The 'Welday_et_al_Fig7AC' folder contains MATLAB code that
simulates spatially tuned neurons by solving the analytic envelope
equation for VCOs. The code for Fig. 7C simulates VCOs as output from
a matrix of ring oscillators.

3) The 'Welday_et_al_Fig9AB' folder contains NEURON code that was used
to simulate a place cell on a linear track in Figs. 9A and 9B.

4) The 'Welday_et_al_Fig9C' folder contains NEURON code that was used
to simulate a grid, place, and border cell in a circular environment,
shown in Fig. 9C. Input to the model comes from simulated theta cell
spike trains, which must generated by running the provided MATLAB
scripts prior to running the NEURON simulation.

   A single compartment model reproduces the firing rate maps of place, grid, and boundary cells by receiving inhibitory inputs from theta cells.  The theta cell spike trains are modulated by the rat's movement velocity in such a way that phase interference among their burst pattern creates spatial envelope function which simulate the firing rate maps.Reference: Welday AC, Shlifer IG, Bloom ML, Zhang K, Blair HT (2011) Cosine Directional Tuning of Theta Cell Burst Frequencies: Evidence for

Comparison of neuronal spike exchange methods on a Blue Gene/P supercomputer.
Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience.

See http://www.neuron.yale.edu/hg/z/neuron/nrnbgp/ for the NEURON version
actually used to carry out the simulation on the Blue Gene/P.
Figures 3 and 9 require this version as the hoc code uses several features
not yet available in the standard versions. The relevant statements are:
init.hoc: {pc.timeout(1)}
net.hoc: pc.gid_clear(4)
param.hoc and perfrun.hoc: any use of pc.send_time(x) with x &amp;gt; 4

The DCMF_Multicast methods used in the paper are specific to the Blue Gene/P.
However the MPI multisend implementation can be used on any MPI installed
system. In particular the two-phase exchange method may be useful.
The exchange methods are implemented mostly in src/nrniv/bgpdma.cpp .

DOI: 10.1007/s10827-011-0368-2

The original model is proposed by Gunay et al.(2008) as a
multi-compartmental model.  We modified values of ionic conductances
so that the single compartmental model shows the similar firing
activity to that of the original model.

After building the mod files, run the demo.hoc file.

   We investigated how changes in ionic conductances alter the phase response curve (PRC) of a globus pallidal (GP) neuron and stability of a synchronous activity of a GP network, using a single-compartmental conductance-based neuron model. The results showed the PRC and the stability were influenced by changes in the persistent sodium current, the Kv3 potassium, the M-type potassium and the calcium-dependent potassium current.Reference: Fujita T, Fukai T, Kitano K (2011) Influences of membrane properties on phase response curve and synchronization stability in a model globus pallidus neuron.

Zhou Y, Colburn HS (2010) A modeling study of the effects of membrane
afterhyperpolarization on spike interval statistics and on ILD
encoding in the lateral superior olive. &lt;a href=&quot;http://jn.physiology.org/content/103/5/2355.full&quot;&gt;J Neurophysiol&lt;/a&gt; 103:2355-71

This model was contributed by Yi Zhou.

&lt;h2&gt;A: Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
This simulation study investigated how membrane afterhyperpolarization
(AHP) influences spiking activity of neurons in the Lateral Superior
Olive (LSO). The model incorporates a general integrate-and-fire
spiking mechanism with a first-order adaptation channel. Simulations
focus on differentiating the effects of GAHP, tau_AHP, and input strength
on (1) spike interval statistics, such as negative serial correlation
and chopper onset, and (2) neural sensitivity to interaural level
difference (ILD) of LSO neurons. The model simulated
electrophysiological data collected in cat LSO (Tsuchitani and
Johnson, 1985). The complete set of simulation results were reported
in &lt;a href=&quot;http://jn.physiology.org/content/103/5/2355.full&quot;&gt;Zhou and Colburn (2010)&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;B: Download&lt;/h2&gt;

This model was written in the NEURON simulation environment. After
installing NEURON, download and unzip the model package
LSO_ZhouColburn.zip to a local directory (e.g., C:/Neuron/LSO). Use
nrnivmodl to compile mod files, and then execute the main NEURON
programs (LSO_current_input.hoc or LSO_synaptic_input.hoc). The LSO
model neuron receives synaptic inputs whose firing rate functions are
stored in the input directory, e.g., &quot;C:/Neuron/LSO/input&quot;. The
simulation results are saved in the output directory, e.g.,
&quot;C:/Neuron/LSO/output&quot;. Two Matlab scripts in the model package,
func_current_stim.m and func_syn_stim.m, provide example commands for
data importing and plotting.

&lt;b&gt;System Requirements:&lt;/b&gt;

NEURON program. Please refer to the general NEURON documentation
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/docs&quot;&gt;http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/docs&lt;/a&gt;) for furtherinstructions on
compiling mod files and launching hoc files on different operating
systems.  Matlab software (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mathworks.com&quot;&gt;http://www.mathworks.com&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;h2&gt;C: Model Descriptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cell Model:&lt;/b&gt;

An LSO cell was simulated using a modified leaky integrate-and-fire
(LIF) model containing a capacitance Cm, a leak conductance GL, and
two time-varying conductance-based channels, Gabs and gAHP(t), which
produced the absolute and relative refractory periods, respectively,
for a model cell. After the absolute refractory period (t_abs), the
conductance of the adaptation channel gAHP(t) was increased by GAHP
and decayed exponentially toward zero with a time constant
tau_AHP. Responses of four model cells were tested in modeling, which
have small or large GAHP and short or long tau_AHP. (See Table I in
Zhou and Colburn, 2010.)

&lt;b&gt;Input Model:&lt;/b&gt;

Stimulation was provided through either current injection (which
simulated the ipsilateral-alone stimulation) or through
synaptic-conductance channels (which simulated the combined effects of
ipsilateral and contralateral acoustic stimulation).

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The current stimulation was implemented in LSO_current_input.hoc. The
model cell received a random discrete current at a sampling rate of
4000 Hz. The amplitude of the current within each sample period (0.25
ms) was a Gaussian random variable with a mean of I and an SD of
sigma_I; and both I and sigma_I were time-invariant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The synaptic stimuation was implemented in
LSO_synaptic_input.hoc. Mathematically generated spike trains
simulated the ipsilateral excitatory and contralateral inhibitory
input spike trains (50 per side) to a LSO neuron. The input spike
times were loaded during NEURON simulation. The excitatory and
inhibitory synaptic time constant was 1ms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;D: Simulations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example test 1: Stochastic current injection&lt;/h3&gt;

Run LSO_current_input.hoc to launch the screen below. The command and
parameter panels are shown on the left and the three result panels are
shown on the right. On the parameter panels, shown from the top to
bottom shown the leak conductance, Gabs and t_abs, AHP channel, and
injecting current properties.

Specify the AHP channel and current properties. The default setting is
those of the model cell 4 (GAHP =0.08uS and tau_AHP=5ms). The default
current input has I_mean of 1.4nA and sigma_I of 0.4nA. The values of
passive leak conductance and absolute refractory period (2ms) were
those reported in Zhou and Colburn (2010).

Hit Run. Shown on the middle result panel is the PSTH, and those on
the right from top to bottom are the recovery function, the
inter-spike interval histograms of the steady state of responses (&gt;40
msec), the serial dependence of GAHP, and the serial dependence of
interspike intervals. Methods of data analyses are given in Zhou and
Colburn (2010).

Hit WriteFile, which saves eight data files into the subfolder
/output. Each file was named after AHP channel and input current
parameters.

Run Matlab script func_current_stim.m, which plots the results of all
4 model cells in response to current stimulation with I_mean =1.4nA
and sigma_I = 0.4nA.

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=143114&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\ZhouColburn2010\.\current_edit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot 1&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Example test 2: Synaptic stimulation with binaural EI inputs&lt;/h2&gt;

Run LSO_synaptic_input.hoc to launch the screen below. Main procedures
are identical to the program shown above. The default setting used the
model cell 1 (GAHP =0.02 uS and tau_AHP=20 ms). The peak conductance
of excitatory (Ge) and inhibitory (Gi) conductance are 3ns and 1.2ns,
respectively. This setting yields a net zero synaptic current at the
spiking threshold (i.e., balanced excitation and inhibition).  See
Methods in Zhou and Colburn (2010) for more details.

To specify an ILD, click Choose E Input Rate and then choose from the
pull-down menu a desired ipsilateral (excitatory) sound level. Do the
same for contralateral (inhibitory) sound level.

Hit Run. The results shown on the screen were obtained by using
E=50dB and I=10dB.

Hit WriteFile, which saves eight data files into the subfolder
/output. Each file was named after AHP channel and E/I level. The
sound pressure level from 0 to 70dB are coded by letters A to H,
respectively.

Run Matlab script func_syn_stim.m, which plots the results of the 4
model cells in response to binaural inputs with E=50dB and I=10dB.

This document provides brief installation and usage instructions.

INSTALLATION

Note: the code has been designed to work on Linux machines. It may
work on Macs and will definitely not work on Windows. If this is a
problem, please contact Cliff Kerr (cliffk@neurosim.downstate.edu) for
assistance.

Dependencies:
1. NEURON
2. Python
3. Pylab, SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Note that Matplotlib must be
version &amp;gt;1.0 -- note that most Linux distributions still come with
0.99; if this is a problem, you'll get the error &quot;ImportError: cannot
import name sca&quot;.

Instructions:

1. Unzip all files (which it looks like you've already done).
2. Type &quot;nrnivmodl *.mod&quot; in the directory. This should create a
directory called either i686 or x86_64, depending on your computer's
architecture, and put a file called &quot;special&quot; in that directory.


USAGE

1. Type &quot;runsim&quot;. Two graphs should appear, corresponding to the two
types of results figures in the paper.


OPTIONS

* To adjust cortical vs. thalamic damage, simulation time, and model
  size, please adjust the hopefully-clearly-labeled parameters in
  runsim.

General description of the model:

This model explores conductance distributions in dendrites for
comparison to voltage-sensitive dye optical recordings from
thalamic interneuron dendrites in the dorsal lateral geniculate
nucleus.
The purpose is to assess action potential kinetics and amplitude in
thalamic interneuron dendrite models under different dendritic
conductance distributions.

Example Use:

The auto-launch (mosinit.hoc) will start the simulation with the
configuration that most closely matched experiment. Compile the mod
files first with mknrndll (MAC and mswin) or nrnivmodl (linux/unix) if
starting manually. Click the measure button to run the simulation and
generate graphs of kinetics.  A graph similar to that in Figure 10E's
50-25% red line is among those displayed:

determined in the previous run.

This is the README for the model associated with the paper

Powers RK, ElBasiouny SM, Rymer WZ and Heckman CJ. Contributions of
intrinsic properties and synaptic inputs to motoneuron discharge
patterns: a simulation study.  J Neurophys, 107:808-823, 2012.

These files were contributed by Randy Powers.

Usage: This archive contains all the files necessary to produce the
responses of a medium threshold motoneuron to the triangular
current-clamp, voltage-clamp and noisy conductance commands used in
Powers et al. 2012.  These simulations use and require that NEURON
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neuron.yale.edu&quot;&gt;http://www.neuron.yale.edu&lt;/a&gt;)
is installed. The base code and mod files are in the subfolder &quot;code&quot;.
The files for initiating the simulations and for specifying the
parameters for a medium threshold motoneuron are in the subfolder
&quot;MN_hoc_and_output&quot;.

Either auto-launch from ModelDB or compile the mod files in the code
folder with mknrndll (MacOS and mswin) or by typing &quot;nrnivmodl code&quot;
(unix/linux).  You can start the simulation by with either the
mosinit.hoc file, init_synss.hoc, or init_gramp.hoc.  The former
allows you to select either of the latter by clicking a button.  The
file init_synss.hoc is used for current-clamp and voltage-clamp
simulations, whereas init_gramp.hoc is used for the simulating
responses to synaptic conductance commands.


Upon running init_synss.hoc, the NEURON Main Menu and a window
entitled &quot;FR motoneuron control panel&quot; will appear.  Click the pick a
file button and pick Medium_thresh_MN.hoc. Then click Exit on the file
chooser. Then click the &quot;Choose analysis&quot; button and pick either FI
for the current-clamp simulation or IV for the voltage-clamp
simulation.  If you click &quot;GO&quot; the &quot;IV&quot; simulation will generate
Fig. 1E:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=143671&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\PowersEtAl2012\fig1e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fig. 1 E&quot; /&gt;

and Fig. 1F:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=143671&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\PowersEtAl2012\fig1f.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fig. 1 F&quot; /&gt;

After the simulation is finished an output text file is
generated that either lists injected current and spike time values
(for current-clamp) or voltage command and voltage-clamp current
values (for voltage clamp).  For the voltage-clamp simulation you have
the option of looking at the effects of tonic excitatory input, by
clicking the enable synaptic input button.

Upon running init_gramp.hoc you can record the responses to the
various mixtures of excitatory and inhibitory input used in Powers et
al. 2012 by executing the commands in the file gramp_commands.

To estimate the potential contributions of PIC (Persistent Inward Current) activation and synaptic input patterns to
motor unit discharge patterns, we examined the responses of a set of cable
motoneuron models to different patterns of excitatory and inhibitory
inputs.

The models were first tuned to approximate the current- and
voltage-clamp responses of low- and medium-threshold spinal motoneurons
studied in decerebrate cats and then driven with different patterns of
excitatory and inhibitory inputs.

The responses of the models to excitatory
inputs reproduced a number of features of human motor unit
discharge.

However, the pattern of rate modulation was strongly influenced
by the temporal and spatial pattern of concurrent inhibitory inputs.

Thus, even though PIC activation is likely to exert a strong influence on
firing rate modulation, PIC activation in combination with different
patterns of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs can produce a wide
variety of motor unit discharge patterns.&quot;Reference: Powers RK, Elbasiouny SM, Rymer WZ, Heckman CJ (2011) Contribution of Intrinsic Properties and Synaptic Inputs to Motoneuron Discharge Patterns: A Simulation Study.

On the mechanisms underlying the depolarization block in the spiking
dynamics of CA1 pyramidal neurons by D.Bianchi, A. Marasco,
A.Limongiello, C.Marchetti, H.Marie,B.Tirozzi, M.Migliore (2012).
J Comput Neurosci.

The CA1 morphological neuron model has been implemented starting by
merging model files from Poirazi et al. (ModelDB accession number
20212), and from Shah et al. (ModelDB accession number 112546),
adapting a few parameters from their original values to take into
account the specific set of experimental traces used in this work, as
discussed in the Appendix of the paper.

The Simulation.hoc file in the &quot;experiment&quot; directory will reproduce
the results in Fig. 5 of the paper.

The Mathematica file refers to the bifurcation analysis of the
specific somatic model used in the paper.
The file will be visualized correctly with Mathematica, so save it on
your pc and then open with the software.

To run the simulation which will reproduce the results in Fig. 9, type
SHIFT + ENTER in the current Mathematica session.

Experimental findings shown that under sustained input current of increasing strength neurons eventually stop firing, entering a depolarization block.
We analyze the spiking dynamics of CA1 pyramidal neuron models using the same set of ionic currents on both an accurate morphological reconstruction and on its reduction to a single-compartment.
 The results show the specific ion channel properties and kinetics that are needed to
reproduce the experimental findings, and how their interplay can drastically modulate the neuronal dynamics and the input current range leading to depolarization block.Reference: Bianchi D, Marasco A, Limongiello A, Marchetti C, Marie H, Tirozzi B, Migliore M (2012) On the mechanisms underlying the depolarization block in the spiking dynamics of CA1 pyramidal neurons

McTavish TS, Migliore M, Shepherd GM, Hines ML (2012) Mitral cell
spike synchrony modulated by dendrodendritic synapse
location. Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience. 6, January 2012,
DOI:10.3389/fncom.2012.00003.

These files were contributed by Thomas McTavish [thomas.mctavish at
yale.edu] and build off the model by Migliore et al, 2010, running
under the NEURON simulation environment.

General description of the model:

This model considers synchrony between mitral cells induced via shared
granule cell interneurons while taking into account the spatial
constraints of the system. In particular, since inhibitory inputs
decay passively along the lateral dendrites, this model demonstrates
that an optimal arrangement of the inhibitory synapses will be near
the cell bodies of the relevant mitral cells.

Usage:

The complete model has 5 mitral cells and 100 granule cells. An output
file of spike times is provided (spikeout.spk). The parameters that
gave rise to this output file are specified in params.hoc. Figure 1
can be redrawn with this spike data and without running a simulation
via the python command:

$ python analysis.py

which will write a Fig1.pdf file, assuming Python with numpy and
matplotlib are installed. (Enthought Python Distribution will do it).
You also need to have the neuronpy library installed, which can be
obtained via the Python Package Index and the command:

$ [sudo] pip install neuronpy

Running Simulations:

There are two ways to run simulations. One way is to run a full
simulation with 5 mitral cells and 100 granule cells. This is
computationally expensive. The other way takes the spikes from a full
simulation and with the PatternStim, plays back particular cells of
interest using the relevant spikes that input onto the cells of
interest.

Preliminaries:

First compile the mod files in the src folder with mknrndll (MAC and
mswin) or nrnivmodl (linux/unix).

Playback mode:

Launch mosinit.hoc from the src folder. This uses the default
parameters of params.hoc and the associated spikeout.spk file as
input. The 5 mitral cells and 100 granule cells are shown in the main
window. Most figures in the paper consider the left-most and
right-most mitral cells of the network and the granule cells near to
each of their somas. (Even though there are other active cells in the
network, they are not coupled. That is, mitral cells 1 and 5 share
granule cells that are unique from mitral cells 2 and 4, which share a
different set of granule cells. The middle mitral cell is a control to
observe its activity without granule cell connectivity. The reason for
this grid architecture of 5 mitral cells to 100 granule cells was
simply to utilize the network design from our previous models
(Migliore, et al., 2010)). Select a mitral cell (triangle cell body)
and select the &quot;Simulate&quot; button (here is an example with the first
and fifth cells selected:)

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=144054&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\mctavish_syncbylocation\.\screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;

Then you can select &quot;Init and Run&quot; to perform the simulation, which
will animate the spikes in the network and show the membrane response
of the selected mitral cell soma.

Full simulation:
A full simulation can be launched by running:

$ nrniv parinit.hoc

or better,

mpiexec -n &lt;numhosts&gt; nrniv parinit.hoc

if you have MPI. This will replace the existing spike output files, so
be careful. Every 100ms of simulation time will be printed to the
screen. On a 2010 MacBook Pro, this runs at about 2 minutes per 100ms
of simulation. The spikeout.dat file created can be converted to the
spikeout file via the bash command

$ sort -k 1n,1n -k 2n,2n spikeout.dat &gt; spikeout.spk

which properly sorts the spike times.

Model and simulation parameters can be modified via params.hoc.
&lt;/numhosts&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

   &lt;pre&gt;================================  BASICS  =====================================

The general approach is to run generate_variability_sims, which will generate a
large number of NEURON hocfiles, as well as shell scripts to execute
them. Run the shell scripts and make sure data appears reasonable. 

Then, use analyse_model.m to analyze.

NOTE: the following instructions are geared to unix-like operating
systems (Linux, Mac OS X). If you are running WINDOWS, you will
have to figure out a way to do adapt the following instructions (best
is to get a proper OS like Linux). 
 
================================  STEP - BY - STEP ============================

1) install NEURON on your system &amp; use it to compile the .mod
files. This last step is achieved by invoking from a shell the script nrnivmodl,
which is located in the NEURON install directory. This script should
be invoked from the directory where the .mod files are located.
In the following we will call this directory SIMS_ROOT.

The call to nrnivmodl will create a directory containing an executable
version of neuron called special. The name of the directory is related
to the architecture of the system. For example on a linux machine the
name will most likely be i686. On a unix-mac, umac. This name needs to put in 
the variable 

    	special_dir= '../umac'; %where the special program created by
                             	    	%nrnivmodl is located     

By default, it is set to umac. Note that this is RELATIVE TO THE
hocfiles_rootpath DIRECTORY. 

2) make a directory where generated NEURON .hoc files will be put; in 
generate_dirsel_sims, replace 'hocfiles' in the line:

	hocfile_rootpath = 'hocfiles'; % where hocfiles will go and from where simulations are run

with whatever your directory is.  Or just make a hocfiles subdirectory in
the directory where all the simulation code is (i.e., SIMS_ROOT).

3) make an output directory where the simulations will output ASCII files to
when run from NEURON.  In generate_dirsel_sims, replace '../simout'
with your directory:

		params(2).idstr = 'outfilePath';
		params(2).value = '../simout';

Note that this is RELATIVE TO THE hocfiles_rootpath DIRECTORY.  In the
default scheme, if hocfiles is in wherever all the hoc code is, then in that
same directory you would make a directory using 

     	       cd SIMS_ROOT/hocfiles
     	       mkdir ../simout 

This will create a subdirectory of the parent to hocfiles_rootpath (by
default SIMS_ROOT).  Use full paths if you are not sure.

4) Configure generate_variability_sims as you wish ; definitely assign the number of
CPUs you have:

   	n_cpus = 7;

Here, 7 = (8-1) because this was done with 8 CPUs.  Use 1 instead of 7 on a
1 CPU system.  If you use multiple machines (with simulation files on shared network drive), 
then you can use notation like 

    n_cpus = [7 7];
    
where each number is the number of processors used on each machine. Also note that 
the 'special_dir' folder becomes a cell array of strings specifying the appropriate 
directory for each machine.  

This is only if you use the shell-generated run scripts that are created by the call

	generate_sh_files(n_cpus, 1, hoc_idx, hocfile_rootpath, special_dir);  


5) start MATLAB; from within the directory that generate_variability_sims.m resides,
add the support directory (with subdirectories) to the matlab path, and run generate_variability_sims.
	 
6) Go into the hocfile_rootpath directory with a shell.  Change the *.sh file
permissions to executable (e.g., 777).  

	    cd SIMS_ROOT/hocfiles
	    chmod u+x *.sh
	 
7) Execute runbatchX.sh on each machine you want, with X being the machine number:

   cd SIMS_ROOT/hocfiles
   ./runbatchX.sh

8) In analyze_model.m, point datadir to wherever your NEURON output is:

	datadir = ['simout' filesep];

The above is the default.

9) Run analyze_model.m, e.g.

 analyze_model('simout/', {'singlefacet_gain_1'}); 

will analyze single facet simulations (if they exist and are named such). 

10) To try a different parameter set  

================================  FILE LIST ===================================

Simulation generation files:

    generate_variability_sims.m: the main file that calls all others -- really, this
	  is all you should need to look at.

    get_spontaneous_syanpses.m: wrapper for generate_synblock that deals with
	  spontaneous synaptic activity.

    generate_synblock.m: generates the NEURON hoc notation-based synapses based
	  on synaptic timing.  Note that all the stuff dealing with visual stimulation
		is handled in generate_dirsel_sims ; this simply generates a very long
		string of NEURON code that is then inserted into a hocfile via 
		generate_hocfiles.

	generate_hocfiles.m: this tool uses active_template.t to generate a specific
	  hoc file with specific parameters

    generate_sh_files.m: based on the # of cpus you expect to have, this will 
	  generate a shell script and subordinate shell scripts that run the
		individual NEURON hocfiles across processors.

    parameter_comparison.rtf: This is a list of the major model parameters and how they have 
       changed (or haven't) between this model and that of Peron et al (2009).

    'support' directory - contains a number of helper functions for generating the simulations and doing
        the analysis.

NEURON support files:

  LGMD_HH_Kdr_sf35.mod: K channel (Hodgkin-Huxley)
  LGMD_HH_Na_sf35.mod: Na channel (Hodgkin-Huxley)
  LGMD_KCa.mod: calcium-dependent potassium channel module
  LGMD_CaL.mod: calcium channel module
  LGMD_Ca.mod: calcium clearance module

	rake_final.hoc: the morphology file simulating LGMD as a simplified &quot;rake&quot; 
	  (or &quot;trident', for the more poetically inclined)

	active_template.t: template for 'active' model with conductances; used by
	  generate_hocfiles.m

Analysis files:

  analyze_model.m: the main plotting tool that reproduces the paper's figures
	  6, and 7.  Mild discrepancies due to synaptic jitter possible.  

  compareLoomingVariability.m: This file generates the bar graphs of figure 8.  
        compareLoomingVariability.mat is the condensed data file for this function. It has the 
        averaged data (.mat) from 10 sets of 50 trials (over 3 l/v values) to estimate variability when 
        eliminating individual sources. This many trials takes a long time to run (even over 4 machines
        if you want to recreate these results - but computation speeds are always increasing). 

  averageModelResultStructs.m: This averages multiple .mat files produced by analyze_model.m and returns
        them in a format that when saved can be used by compareLoomingVariability.m

   A compartmental model of the LGMD with a simplified, rake shaped, excitatory dendrite. It receives spontaneous input and excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs triggered by visual stimuli. It generates realistic responses to looming through the velocity dependent scaling and delay of individual excitatory synaptic inputs, with variability. We use the model to show that the key determinants of output variability are spontaneous input and temporal jitter of the excitatory inputs, rather than variability in magnitude of individual inputs.Reference: Jones PW, Gabbiani F (2012) Impact of Neural Noise on a Sensory-Motor Pathway Signaling Impending Collision.  107:1067-1079

This is the readme for NEURON code developed to reproduce Fig 2B from

Shepherd GM, Brayton RK (1979) Computer simulation of a
dendrodendritic synaptic circuit for self- and lateral-inhibition in
the olfactory bulb. Brain Res 175:377-82

There were typos in Figure 1 (Shepherd, private communication) where
the granule cell spine geometry should have been specified as 3 micron
length, 1 micron diameter head and 1 micron length and 0.2 micron
width neck dimensions.  The granule cell compartments were 70 microns
in length and 1 micron in diameter.

The NEURON models cytoplasmic and membrane resistance, Ri, and Rm, as
well as the excitatory synaptic conductance pulse (a trapezoidal
pulse) were optimized to the original paper Fig 2B:

The above screenshot includes (black lines) that were the
result of using manually traced original curves:

Usage: Auto-launch from ModelDB or download, extract the archive and
compile the mod files in the mod directory by either

typing &quot;nrnivmodl mod&quot; (linux), 
running mknrndll and cd'ing to the mod folder (mswin), or
dragging and dropping the mod folder onto the mknrndll icon (Mac OS X)

Then start with
nrngui mosinit.hoc (linux),
double clicking the mosinit.hoc file in windows explorer (mswin), or
dragging and dropping the mosinit.hoc file on the nrngui icon (Mac OS X).

Once the simulation has started you can either 

1) optimize to find the Ri, Rm, and conductance pulse trapezoidal
shape that matches the paper: On the multiple run fitter window click
on Parameters -&gt; Select Optimizer -&gt; Praxis, and then click on the
Optimize button in the &quot;MulRunFitter[0] Optimize&quot; box.
After a short time praxis will find the Ri ~ 90 and Rm ~ 1300.

2) or use a previously saved Multiple Run Fitter session to see the
result of optimizing. Close the MulRunFitter[0] main window and select
from the NEURON main menu: File -&gt; load session file, and then using
the popped up file picker, browse to the mrf folder and select
mrf5.ses, which contains the result of a previous optimization.  Now
you can press the ErrorValue button on the newly opened MulRunFitter
window to generate a run.  The graphs will be refreshed with optimized
voltage trajectories.

   The paper demonstrate a form of graded persistent activity activated by hyperpolarization.  This phenomenon is modeled based on a slow calcium regulation of Ih, similar to that introduced
earlier for thalamic neurons (see Destexhe et al., J Neurophysiol. 1996). The only difference is that the calcium signal is here provided by the high-threshold calcium current (instead of the low-threshold calcium current in thalamic neurons).Reference: Winograd M, Destexhe A, Sanchez-Vives MV (2008) Hyperpolarization-activated graded persistent activity in the prefrontal cortex.  105:7298-303

  <description>
   There is suggestive evidence that pyramidal cell axons in neocortex may be coupled by gap junctions into an ``axonal plexus&quot;  capable of generating Very Fast Oscillations (VFOs) with frequencies exceeding 80 Hz. It is not obvious, however, how a pyramidal cell in such a network could control its output when action potentials are free to propagate from the axons of other pyramidal cells into its own axon. We address this problem by means of simulations based on 3D reconstructions of pyramidal cells from rat somatosensory cortex. We show that somatic depolarization enables propagation via gap junctions into the initial segment and main axon, while somatic hyperpolarization disables it. We show further that somatic voltage cannot effectively control action potential propagation through gap junctions on minor collaterals; action potentials may therefore propagate freely from such collaterals regardless of somatic voltage. In previous work, VFOs are all but abolished during the hyperpolarization phase of slow-oscillations induced by anesthesia in vivo. This finding constrains the density of gap junctions on collaterals in our model and suggests that axonal sprouting due to cortical lesions may result in abnormally high gap junction density on collaterals, leading in turn to excessive VFO activity and hence to epilepsy via kindling.Reference: Munro E, Kopell N (2012) Subthreshold somatic voltage in neocortical pyramidal cells can control whether spikes propagate from the axonal plexus to axon terminals: a model study

Differential effects of Kv7 (M-) channels on synaptic integration in distinct subcellular compartments of rat
hippocampal pyramidal neurons. J Physiol. 2011 589:6029-38.

In this study, using a combination of electrophysiology
and computational modelling, we show that these channels selectively influence
peri-somatic but not dendritic post-synaptic excitatory synaptic potential (EPSP) integration in
CA1 pyramidal cells. This may be important for their relative contributions to physiological
processes such as synaptic plasticity as well as patho-physiological conditions such as epilepsy.
The fig-3c.hoc reproduces the traces shown in Fig.3c of the paper.

Model of pyramidal CA1 cells connected by gap junctions in their axons.

Cell geometry is based on anatomical reconstruction of rat CA1 cell
(NeuroMorpho.Org ID: NMO_00927) with long axonal arbor.
Model init_2cells.hoc shows failures of second spike propagation in a
spike doublet, depending on conductance of an axonal gap junction.
Model init_ring.hoc shows that spike failure result in reentrant
oscillations of a spike in a loop of axons connected by gap junctions,
where one gap junction is weak.

  <description>
   Model of pyramidal CA1 cells connected by gap junctions in their axons.
Cell geometry is based on anatomical reconstruction of rat CA1 cell (NeuroMorpho.Org ID: NMO_00927) with long axonal arbor.

Model init_2cells.hoc shows failures of second spike propagation in a spike doublet, depending on conductance of an axonal gap junction.

Model init_ring.hoc shows that spike failure result in reentrant oscillations of a spike in a loop of axons connected by gap junctions, where one gap junction is weak.

The paper shows that in random networks of axons connected by gap junctions, oscillations are driven by single pacemaker loop of axons. The shortest loop, around which a spike can travel, is the most likely pacemaker.
This principle allows us to predict the frequency of oscillations from network connectivity and visa versa.  We propose that this type of oscillations corresponds to so-called fast ripples in epileptic hippocampus.Reference: Vladimirov N, Tu Y, Traub RD (2012) Shortest loops are pacemakers in

   &lt;pre&gt;Instructions:

1- Copy all the folders in your computer.

2- Compile the mechanisms (in folder ../mechanism) with command
&quot;nrnivmodl&quot; (model is currently linux/unix only)

3- This step is necesary only if some mechanism is changed by the
user. In this version, the neurons are tuned with the current
mechanisms.(Gómez et al,Front Comput Neurosci 2011)

   For tunning the neuron:
     a) Select the cell that you want to tune in file
     &quot;../experiment/tune-synapses/Simulation_gradient.hoc&quot; in the
     variable ID_cell=1,2... (1=n123, 2=n125, 3=n128, 4=n129, 5=n130)
     b) Execute the tunning (../experiment/tune-synapses/sh
     run_simulation_gradient) and to copy output file in
     ../junio/tuned-nXXX-trunk/


4- Run simulation:

    a) Select the cell that you want to study in file
      &quot;proximalCA1_1.hoc&quot; in the variable ID_cell=1,2... (1=n123,
      2=n125, 3=n128, 4=n129, 5=n130)
    b) Select the Parameters inside
      &quot;../experiment/junio/ParameterFile.hoc&quot;
    c) Design the protocols inside
      &quot;../experiment/junio/ProtocolsFile.hoc&quot;
    d) Execute &quot;../experiment/junio/ sh run_ProtocolsFile.hoc&quot;

  <description>
   The hippocampus in well known for its role in learning and memory processes. The CA1 region is the output of the hippocampal formation and pyramidal neurons in this region are the elementary units responsible for the processing and transfer of information to the cortex. Using this detailed single neuron model, it is investigated the conditions under which individual CA1 pyramidal neurons process incoming information in a complex (non-linear) as opposed to a passive (linear) manner.
This detailed compartmental model of a CA1 pyramidal neuron is based on one described previously (Poirazi, 2003). The model was adapted to five different reconstructed morphologies for this study, and slightly modified to fit the experimental data of (Losonczy, 2006), and to incorporate evidence in pyramidal neurons for the non-saturation of NMDA receptor-mediated conductances by single glutamate pulses. We first replicate the main findings of (Losonczy, 2006), including the very brief window for nonlinear integration using single-pulse stimuli. We then show that double-pulse stimuli increase a CA1 pyramidal neuron&amp;rsquo;s tolerance for input asynchrony by at last an order of magnitude. Therefore, it is shown using this model, that the time window for nonlinear integration is extended by more than an order of magnitude when inputs are short bursts as opposed to single spikes.

24;30 (47):15713-25.  doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3068-10.2010

Folders:

&quot;..\morphology\&quot; : contains the morphology of the model cell 
&quot;..\mechanism\&quot;  : contains mechanisms of the model cell 
&quot;..\experiment\&quot; : contains experiments and data of simulations 


Instructions:

0- Auto-launch from ModelDB and skip to step 3 or:
1- Copy all the folders into your computer.
2- To Compile the mechanisms, you have to execute &quot;clean-compile.bat&quot;
file in folder &quot;..\mechanism\mechanism_cell1\&quot; (for mswin).  For
linux/unix compile the mod files with nrnivmodl.
3- Simulations:    

   a) Execute &quot;run.hoc&quot; from &quot;..\experiment\&quot; folder.
   b) Fit the morphology variable (diameter and length of dendrites
   and soma, position and morphology of the spine) and parameters of
   the mechanisms, etc, if it was necessary.
   c) There are two options to run:
          i) One run: Press the &quot;Run&quot; key, in this case, it executes
          one simulation. If you wanted to save the data, you have to
          select a &quot;Number of Folder&quot;, for example &quot;1&quot;, and if you
          press the key &quot;Save&quot;, the data will save in
          &quot;..\experiment\data_1&quot;.

          ii) Multi-runs: Press the &quot;Auto Runs&quot; key, in this case, it
          executes multiple simulations. The number of runs is given
          in &quot;..\experiment\Protocols.hoc&quot; file, in addition, it is
          able to define the protocols that you want to apply for
          every run. By default, Delgado et al, 2010 defined the
          position from the spine to the soma for every run. The data
          will save automatically into folders named &quot;data_XX&quot;, XX is
          the distance from the spine to the soma.

  <description>
   Neocortical neurons in vivo process each of their individual inputs in the context of ongoing synaptic background activity, produced by the thousands of presynaptic partners a typical neuron has. That background activity affects multiple aspects of neuronal and network function. However, its effect on the induction of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is not clear.
Using the present biophysically-detailed computational model, it is not only able to replicate the conductance-dependent shunting of dendritic potentials (Delgado et al,2010), but show that synaptic background can truncate calcium dynamics within dendritic spines, in a way that affects potentiation more strongly than depression.
This program uses a simplified layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron constructed in NEURON.
It was similar to the model of Traub et al., J Neurophysiol. (2003), and consisted of a soma, an apical shaft, distal dendrites, five basal dendrites, an axon, and a single spine. The spine&amp;rsquo;s location was variable along the apical shaft (initial 50 &amp;#956;m) and apical. The axon contained an axon hillock region, an initial segment, segments with myelin, and nodes of Ranvier, in order to have realistic action potential generation. For more information about the model see supplemental material, Delgado et al 2010.Reference: Delgado JY, Gómez González JF, Desai NS (2010) Pyramidal neuron conductance state gates spike-timing-dependent plasticity  30(47):15713-25

These NEURON simulator files were contributed by Dr J Luthman.  The
NEURON simulator is available for free download from
http://www.neuron.yale.edu

Usage:

Auto-launch from ModelDB after installing NEURON or download and
extract this archive, compile the mod files with mknrndll (mswin, mac)
or nrnivmodl (unix/linux).  Start the simulation with mosinit.hoc by
double clicking (mswin), or dragging and dropping onto nrngui (mac) or
typing &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot; on the command line (unix/linux).

Once the simulation has started press the DCNrun() button.  After a
minute (~45 seconds on a 2.4 GHz intel core duo p8600 laptop) sample
data files containing spike information and traces will be written to
disk:

OutputDCN_soma_1s_ap.dat, OutputDCN_soma_1s_time.dat
OutputDCN_soma_1s_trace.dat.

   &quot;... We use a
conductance-based model of a CN neuron to study the
effect of the regularity of Purkinje cell spiking on CN
neuron activity.

We find that increasing the irregularity of
Purkinje cell activity accelerates the CN neuron spike rate
and that the mechanism of this recoding of input irregularity
as output spike rate depends on the number of Purkinje
cells converging onto a CN neuron.

   &lt;pre&gt;Simulations using the Python interface to Neuron 7.2 (Development
Version)
Written by Brandon Aubie
brandon@aubie.ca

How to Use
==========
Install NEURON along with the Python interface.  To make use of
multiple cores (or workstations), install the OpenMP toolset.

View run.py for instructions on running different simulations and
reproducing a subset of the figures in Aubie et al. (2012).

In general, once you have a simulation defined (the appropriate lines
uncommented in run.py), you can simply run:

# ./run

and the simulations will run in multiple threads.  If OpenMP is not
available on your system, you can simply run:

# python run.py

Output files are CSV files suitable for producing graphs with many
graphing programs such as GLE (http://glx.sourceforge.net/).

   These models reproduce the responses of duration-tuned neurons in the auditory midbrain of the big brown bat, the rat, the mouse and the frog (Aubie et al. 2012).  They are written in the Python interface to NEURON and a subset of the figures from Aubie et al. (2012) are pre-set in run.py (raw data is generated and a separate graphing program must be used to visualize the results).Reference: Aubie B, Sayegh R, Faure PA (2012) Duration Tuning across Vertebrates  32(18):6373-90

This model reproduces the cardiac action potentials and pacemaker
activity of a mammalian cell of the sinoatrial node.

It is based on the paper by :

DiFrancesco D &amp; Noble D (1985) A model of cardiac electrical activity
incorporating ionic pumps and concentration changes.
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 307:353-398
[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2578676&quot; target=&quot;url&quot;&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;]

implemented and modified for Neuron by Francois E. Gannier
	from University of Tours - FRANCE
	Physiologie des Cellules Cardiaques et Vasculaires
	email address: francois.gannier@univ-tours.fr

It was the first model to incorporate the external and internal
concentration changes and has been very influential in directing
modeling efforts.

To run the simulation auto-launch the model from modeldb or download
and extract the archive and then compile the mod files under:

unix/linux:
-----------
type nrnivmodl in the DiFrancescoNoble1985 folder and then
nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin:
------
run mknrndll and then double click on mosinit.hoc

MAC OS X:
--------
Drag and drop the DiFrancescoNoble1985 folder onto the mknrndll icon.  
Drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

Once the simulation starts it recreates the Fig. 6 of the original
paper:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=144520&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\DiFrancescoNoble1985\.\fig6.jpg&quot; /&gt;

   &lt;pre&gt;This model reproduces Figure 6a and 6b and Supplementary Figure 5b of
the article

&quot;State and location dependence of action potential metabolic cost in
cortical pyramidal neurons&quot;. Nature Neuroscience (2012)
doi:10.1038/nn.3132

When the folder is compiled using the mknrndll script the simulation
can be started with &quot;mosinit.hoc&quot;.

The newly developed model of the axonal K+ currents (Kv1_axonal.mod)
was based on step evoked K+ currents including activation,
deactivation and inactivation protocols as well as steady state
curves. To describe the activation, eight Hodgkin-Huxley gates were
used (n^8). To describe the biphasic inactivation and recovery from
inactivation, two populations of channels with different
Hodgkin-Huxley inactivation gates were used (n^8*h1^+n^8*h2).

To analyze the AP efficiency and the ATP usage on a subcellular level,
the Na+/K+ charge overlap, the excess Na+ influx and the ATP usage
were calculated as RANGE variables (charge.mod).

Executing &quot;ch()&quot; in the terminal shell (see charge.hoc) will print
average ATP usage per cellular compartment as shown below (some of the
information is exported into text files).

Demonstration of Hopfield-Brody snychronization using artificial cells in NEURON+python.

The main file in this demonstration is net.py

To use:
 1. unzip the contents of the zip file
 2. nrnivmodl , to compile the mod files
 3. ./x86_64/special -python net.py

The third step will run the simulation for 500 ms of simulation time and display
the spikes of the cells as red dots. The vertical blue lines indicate the
synchronization between the cells. The third step also assumes your computer's
architecture is 64-bit. If not, then the special file will be created in a
different sub-directory.

Shunting Current Explains the Puzzling Effects of Its Pharmacological
or Pathological Modulations. PLoS ONE 7(5): e36867.
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0036867


The non-specific, hyperpolarization activated, Ih current is
particularly involved in epilepsy and it exhibits an excitatory or
inhibitory action on synaptic integration in an apparently
inconsistent way. With a series of simulations, using a realistic
model, we show how and why a shunting current, such as that carried by
TASK-like channels, dependent on the Ih peak conductance, is able to
explain virtually all experimental findings on Ih up- or
down-regulation by modulators or pathological conditions.

The hoc file &quot; fig-5a&quot; is a typical simulation file, for illustration
purposes only, that reproduces the results reported in Fig. 5a:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=144541&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\Ih_current\.\screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;

It tests the peak somatic membrane potential as a function of synaptic
stimulation strength using I_lk with lk = 0.7 (i.e. 70% of the peak Ih
conductance) under control conditions (red) and no Ih (blue).  Ih
increases the peak depolarization for weak inputs and reduces it for
stronger inputs.

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command
nrnivmodl
and run the simulation hoc file with the command
nrniv fig-5a.hoc


Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
fig-5a.hoc
will open the simulation window.

1) Build the neuron load library from the command line
nrnivmodl mod

2) The python script des2runs.py reads the design file created by Nimrod,
creates a PBS run file which passes the parameters to neuron model and 
submits the run to the PBS queueing system.

3) The matlab script EFPgen.m reads the output files and generates local 
field traces in matlab format (EFP.mat)

4) The matlab script EFP2PSD.m reads the EPF data and creates power spectra
in matlab format (PSD.mat)

5) The matlab script singleoutput.m reads the PSD file and generates the
output used in figs 4, 5 and 6 of the paper.

You will almost certainly need to modify these scripts to work in your
environment.

   Using the Traub et al (2005) model of the cortex we determined how 33 synaptic strength parameters control gamma oscillations. We used fractional factorial design to reduce the number of runs required to 4096. We found an expected multiplicative interaction between parameters.Reference: Chambers JD, Bethwaite B, Diamond NT, Peachey T, Abramson D, Petrou S, Thomas EA (2012) Parametric computation predicts a multiplicative interaction between synaptic strength parameters that control gamma oscillations.

Miceli et al, Genotype&amp;ndash;phenotype correlations in neonatal
epilepsies caused by mutations in the voltage
sensor of Kv7.2 potassium channel subunits, PNAS 2013 Feb 25. [Epub ahead of print]

In this paper, functional studies revealed that in homomeric
or heteromeric configuration with KV7.2 and/or KV7.3 subunits, R213W and 
R213Q mutations markedly destabilized the open state, causing a dramatic
decrease in channel voltage sensitivity.
Modeling these channels in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal
cells revealed that both mutations increased cell firing frequency,
with the R213Q mutation prompting more dramatic functional
changes compared with the R213W mutation  The fig4a.hoc
reproduces the traces shown in Fig.4a of the paper.

Under linux/unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui fig6a.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the &quot;mknrndll&quot; command.
A double click on the simulation file
fig6a.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Under MAC OS X:
to compile the mod files drag and drop the extracted folder onto the
mknrndll icon. Drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui
icon.

Once the simulation is started you can select the desired simulation.

Modeling-independent elucidation of inactivation pathways in
recombinant and native A-type Kv channels. J Gen Physiol 2012

These models predict the differential effects of having varying
pathways of inactivation. Model of CA1 pyramidal neuron from Migliore
et al (1999; ModelDB accession #2796) with the A-type potassium
current replaced by Markov models of Kv4 channels.

As in the paper, in file names: 
CSI = closed state inactivation
OSI = open state inactivation
CSIOSI = combined CSI and OSI

To reproduce figures:

	1) Open folder &quot;IonChannelLab files&quot;
	2) Open .ichl file of channel interested in
	3) Click &quot;Simulations&quot; tab 
	4) Underneath &quot;Experiments&quot; select experiment interested in
	5) Click Run
Figure 11C - 
	1) open &quot;Figure11C CSI.hoc&quot; and click &quot;Run Figure 11C CSI&quot;
	2) open &quot;Figure11c CSIOSI.hoc&quot; and click &quot;Run Figure 11C
           CSI+OSI&quot;
Figure 11D -
	1) open &quot;Figure11D.hoc&quot; and click &quot;Run Figure 11D&quot;
Figure 11E-G -
	1) open &quot;Figure11E.hoc&quot; and click &quot;Run Figure 11E&quot;

&quot;Auto Launch&quot; (will start the mosinit.hoc file if you have NEURON
installed and your browser is properly configured) to recreate Figure
11E. Press &quot;Run Figure11E&quot; and in a minute you should see graphs like:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=145672&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\Fineberg_et_al_2012\.\screenshot1.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot 1&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;340&quot; /&gt;

   These models predict the differential effects of varying pathways of inactivation (closed state inactivation, CSI, or open state inactivation, OSI).  Specifically, Markov models of Kv4 potassium channels with CSI or CSI+OSI were inserted into the CA1 pyramidal neuron model from Migliore et al (1999; ModelDB accession #2796) to determine the neurophysiological impact of inactivation pathways.  Furthermore, Markov models of Kv4.2 and Kv3.4 channels are used to illustrate a method by which to test what pathway of inactivation a channel uses.Reference: Fineberg JD, Ritter DM, Covarrubias M (2012) Modeling-independent elucidation of inactivation pathways in recombinant and native A-type Kv channels  140:513-527

  <description>
   Fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (BCs) play a key role in feedforward and feedback inhibition in the hippocampus. 
...
To quantitatively address this question, we developed detailed passive cable models of BCs in the dentate gyrus based on dual somatic or somatodendritic recordings and complete morphologic reconstructions. 

Both specific membrane capacitance and axial resistivity were comparable to those of pyramidal neurons, but the average somatodendritic specific membrane resistance (R(m)) was substantially lower in BCs. 

Furthermore, R(m) was markedly nonuniform, being lowest in soma and proximal dendrites, intermediate in distal dendrites, and highest in the axon. 
...
Further computational analysis revealed that these unique cable properties accelerate the time course of synaptic potentials at the soma in response to fast inputs, while boosting the efficacy of slow distal inputs. 

These properties will facilitate both rapid phasic and efficient tonic activation of BCs in hippocampal microcircuits.

================

David Sterratt, 4th July 2012
-----------------------------

How to run the simulations interactively
========================================

1. Compile all the &quot;.mod&quot; files in this directory using
   the NEURON utility &quot;nrnivmodl&quot; (on GNU/Linux) or mknrndll (on MS
   Windows).

2. Use NEURON to run &quot;bpap-gui.hoc&quot;. A number of windows should appear
   on the screen. This is the interative version of the simulations.

3. Change parameters and options as desired, and then click on &quot;BPAP
   Run&quot;. For example, try setting &quot;AMPA synapses scaled&quot;, and changing
   the &quot;Number of runs&quot; to 5.

4. The simulation will run. Traces appear in the window at the right,
   and various analysis plots will appear in the centre window. The
   top row refers to voltage, and the bottom row to calcium. The left
   column is peak V or Ca, the middle column is integral of V or Ca
   and the right column is time to peak V or Ca.

5. To save the parameters and data, click on &quot;Save Parameters and
   Data&quot;. Click on &quot;Accept&quot; in the window that pops up, and the data
   and parameters will be saved in a file in R format in the datastore
   directory.

6. To plot figures from this file, open up the R program, and type the
   following at the prompt:

   &amp;gt; source(&quot;figure-example.R&quot;)

   The first time this happens you may be prompted to download a
   package - this is intended.

7. To produce further simulations and plots, repeat steps 3 to 6. You
   will need to copy &quot;figure-example.R&quot; to a file with a new name and
   edit the &quot;dataset&quot; line to match the name of the dataset in the
   datastore directory.

How to reproduce the simulations with the standard morphology
=============================================================

1. Compile the mod files as in step (1) above.

2. Use NEURON to run &quot;bpap-sims.hoc&quot;. This will take some time. Data
   files (R text files) will appear in the &quot;datastore&quot; directory.

3. To produced the figures, start R and type:

   &amp;gt; source(&quot;figures.R&quot;)

   Figures will appear in the &quot;plots&quot; directory.

How to reproduce the scaling simulations
========================================

1. Compile the mod files as above.

2. Use NEURON to run &quot;bpap-sims-scaling.hoc&quot;. This will take some
   time. Data files (text files with a .dat suffix) will appear in the
   &quot;datastore&quot; directory.

3. Open MATLAB from the bpap directory and type &quot;scaling_plots&quot;

To run simulations with cells with alternative morphologies (Fig 3B,C)
======================================================================

1. Compile the mod files as above.

2. Use NEURON to run &quot;bpap-sims-cell1.hoc&quot; and
   &quot;bpap-sims-cell2.hoc&quot;. This will take some time. Data files (R text
   files) will appear in the &quot;datastore&quot; directory.

3. These can be plotted using figure-example.R

   This is an adaptation of Poirazi et al.'s  (2003) CA1 model that is used to measure BAP-induced voltage and calcium signals in spines after simulated Schaffer
collateral synapse stimulation.  In the model, the  peak calcium concentration is highly
correlated with soma-synapse distance under a number of physiologically-realistic
suprathreshold stimulation regimes and for a range of dendritic morphologies. There are also simulations demonstrating that peak calcium can be used to set up a synaptic democracy
in a homeostatic manner, whereby synapses regulate their synaptic strength on the
basis of the difference between peak calcium and a uniform target value.Reference: Sterratt DC, Groen MR, Meredith RM, van Ooyen A (2012) Spine calcium transients induced by synaptically-evoked action potentials can predict synapse location and establish synaptic democracy  8(6):e1002545

Amatrudo JM, Weaver CM, Crimins JL, Hof PR, Rosene DL, Luebke JI.
Influence of highly distinctive structural properties on the
excitability of pyramidal neurons in monkey visual and prefrontal
cortices.  In Press, J Neurosci (2012).

These files were contributed by Christina Weaver [christina.weaver at
fandm.edu] and build off the model by Vetter et al. (2001), running
under the NEURON simulation environment.
 
Summary:

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and high-resolution 3D morphometric
analyses of layer 3 pyramidal neurons in in vitro slices of monkey
primary visual cortex (V1) and dorsolateral granular prefrontal cortex
(dlPFC) revealed that neurons in these two brain areas possess highly
distinctive structural and functional properties. ... Three-dimensional
reconstructions of V1 and dlPFC neurons were incorporated into
computational models containing Hodgkin-Huxley and AMPA- and
GABAA-receptor gated channels. Morphology alone largely accounted for
observed passive physiological properties, but led to AP firing rates
that differed more than observed empirically, and to synaptic
responses that opposed empirical results. Accordingly, modeling
predicts that active channel conductances differ between V1 and dlPFC
neurons. The unique features of V1 and dlPFC neurons are likely
fundamental determinants of area-specific network behavior. The
compact electrotonic arbor and increased excitability of V1 neurons
support the rapid signal integration required for early processing of
visual information. The greater connectivity and dendritic complexity
of dlPFC neurons likely support higher level cognitive functions
including working memory and planning.

Three-dimensional reconstructions of V1 and dlPFC neurons were incorporated into computational models containing Hodgkin-Huxley and AMPA- and GABAA-receptor gated channels. Morphology alone largely accounted for observed passive physiological properties, but led to AP firing rates that differed more than observed empirically, and to synaptic responses that opposed empirical results. Accordingly, modeling predicts that active channel conductances differ between V1 and dlPFC neurons. The unique features of V1 and dlPFC neurons are likely fundamental
determinants of area-specific network behavior. The compact electrotonic arbor and increased excitability of V1 neurons support the rapid signal integration required for early processing of visual information. The greater connectivity and dendritic complexity of dlPFC neurons likely
support higher level cognitive functions including working memory and planning.Reference: Amatrudo JM, Weaver CM, Crimins JL, Hof PR, Rosene DL, Luebke JI (2012) Influence of highly distinctive structural properties on the excitability of pyramidal neurons in monkey visual and prefrontal cortices

This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:

Ferrante M, Migliore M, Ascoli GA (2013) Functional Impact of
Dendritic Branch-Point Morphology J. Neurosci. 33:2156-2165

This model was contributed by Michele Ferrante.  The model requires
NEURON which is available at http://www.neuron.yale.edu

Usage:

Auto-launch from ModelDB (starts simulation if browser is properly
setup) or do the following 1) Download and extract the archive.  2)
Compile the mod files (mknrndll on mswin, mac os x, or nrnivmodl
unix/linux). 3) Start the simulation with double clicking the
mosinit.hoc (mswin), drag and dropping the mosinit.hoc file on the
nrngui icon (mac os x) or typing &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot; on the command
line (linux/unix).

Once the simulation has started press the run simulation button (takes
2 1/2 hours on a 2009 pc).  When done you should see figures like the
below which corresponds to the inset in Fig. 1E in the paper:

   &quot; ... Here, we first quantified the morphological variability of branch points from two-photon images of rat CA1 pyramidal neurons. We then investigated the geometrical features affecting spike initiation, propagation, and timing with a computational model validated by glutamate uncaging experiments. The results suggest that even subtle membrane readjustments at branch point could drastically alter the ability of synaptic input to generate, propagate, and time action potentials.&quot;Reference: Ferrante M, Migliore M, Ascoli GA (2013) Functional Impact of Dendritic Branch-Point Morphology

This directory contains NEURON files associated with computing
neuronal responses to a Chirp stimulus in a morphologically realistic
model of a CA1 pyramidal neuron. These files, and the functions
there in, could be used to compute input resistance and to generate
voltage traces in response to a local Chirp current stimulus, along
various trunk locations of the model. The only channel in the model
is the h channel which has a conductance gradient, and increases
with distance from the soma. These files will help recreate results
presented in Fig. 8C of the paper referenced below.

Rishikesh Narayanan and Daniel Johnston, Long-term potentiation
in rat hippocampal neurons is accompanied by spatially widespread
changes in intrinsic oscillatory dynamics and excitability, Neuron,
56(6), pp. 1061-1075, December 2007.

If you choose to save input resistances, the input resistances along
with the corresponding radial distances of the trunk compartment
under consideration  will be saved in a file named &quot;Trunk_RN.txt&quot;.
The actual output that you obtain by running the RN_Trunk() function
is attached.

If you choose to save responses to a Chirp stimulus, the files will
be saved in the Output directory. The traces that one will obtain
by running the &quot;Chirp_Gh()&quot; function are attached in the Output
directory. Only two representative traces corresponding to the first
(&quot;ChirpOutput_0.txt&quot;) and the last (&quot;ChirpOutput_61.txt&quot;) trunk
compartments are attached. Once you run the &quot;Chirp_Gh()&quot;, you should
get all 62 files in the Output directory. The corresponding current
values are in the file &quot;ChirpI.txt&quot;. All these files contain 1002000
points, corresponding to a time period of 25050 ms, with 40 points
per ms.  If impedance analyses were to be performed with values
from saved files in the Output directory as voltage responses, and
values in the file &quot;ChirpI.txt&quot; as the current input, then the
measurements should read as in the file named &quot;Trunk_Z.txt&quot;. It may
be noted that the distances here are the same as those in the
&quot;Trunk_RN.txt&quot; file, as the compartment order is the same.

For details about each of the measurements in these files and on the
gradient in the h channels, refer to the paper mentioned above.

   ...we built a multicompartmental model with a morphologically realistic three-dimensional reconstruction of a CA1 pyramidal neuron. The only active conductance we added to the model was the h conductance. ... We conclude that experimentally observed gradient in density of h channels could theoretically account for experimentally observed gradient in resonance properties (Narayanan and Johnston, 2007).

This is the model associated with the paper

Lavzin M, Rapoport S, Polsky A, Garion L, Schiller J (2012) Nonlinear
dendritic processing determines angular tuning of barrel cortex
neurons in vivo. Nature 490:397-401

This model was contributed by Alon Polsky.  The code is written in
NEURON which is available for free from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neuron.yale.edu&quot;&gt;http://www.neuron.yale.edu&lt;/a&gt;

Usage: Auto-launch from ModelDB or compile the mod files with mknrndll
(mac, mswin) or nrnivmodl (linux/unix).  Start the program by double
clicking mosinit.hoc (mswin), drag and dropping mosinit.hoc onto the
nrngui icon (mac) or typing &quot;nrngui mosinit.hoc&quot; (linux/unix).  Here
is a short description of the panels:

PARAMS

Axon,soma,dends - Conductance of sodium and potassium voltage gated
channels in the axon, the soma and the dendritic tree can be adjusted
using the corresponding panels. L type calcium conductance was
distributed homogeneously and can be controlled with the CaL value.
Iterations -- parameters that determine synaptic distribution:
Downlimit,UPlimit and Countlimit are used in iterations in which the
number of synapses is changed from Downlimit to Uplimit in Countlimit
steps.
TC Ratio -- multiplier of the number of thalamocortical
synapses. (1-number matches the current iteration number, 0 -- no TC
synapses)
CC Ratio, Inhib Ratio -- same as TC Ratio for excitatory and inhibitory
cortico-cortical connections
Calc -- clicking on the button runs the simulation
New Loc- redistribution of the synapses, randomly over the whole
dendtiric tree

SYNAPSES
Delay -- start of synaptic activation
Amp -- mean conductance of a single synapse, in nS. Individual synaptic
conductances are picked from a lognormal distribution with standard
deviation of Amp.
Tspike -- Interval between presynaptic pulses (ms)
Nspike -- number of presynaptic pulses
Nnoise -- presynaptic randomness -- 0 for precise timing, 1 for random
activation
Syn # number of synapses (adjusted automatically for each iteration
when calc button is pressed).
Random synapses are constantly active and provide the background, non
specific to thalamic, activation.

This code was used to generate figures S8, S9 and S13 in the
supplementary information.

Example of activation of the model cell by 40 ThalamoCortical (TC), 12
excitatory CorticoCortical (eCC) and 20 inhibitory CorticoCortical
(iCC) synapses that were randomly distributed across the dendrites.

  <description>
   This is a multi-compartmental simulation of a spiny stellate neuron which is stimulated by a thalamocortical (TC) and cortico-cortical (CC) inputs. No other cells are explicitly modeled; the presynaptic network activation is represented by the number of active synapses. Preferred and non &amp;ndash;preferred thalamic directions thus correspond to larder/smaller number of TC synapses. This simulation revealed that randomly activated synapses can cooperatively trigger global NMDA spikes, which involve participation of most of the dendritic tree.  Surprisingly, we found that although the voltage profile of the cell was uniform, the calcium influx was restricted to &amp;lsquo;hot spots&amp;rsquo; which correspond to synaptic clusters or large conductance synapsesReference: Lavzin M, Rapoport S, Polsky A, Garion L, Schiller J (2012) Nonlinear dendritic processing determines angular tuning of barrel cortex neurons in vivo.  490:397-401

Progressive effect of beta-amyloid peptides accumulation on CA1
pyramidal neurons: a model study suggesting possible treatments.
Front. Comput. Neurosci. 6:52. doi: 10.3389/fncom.2012.00052

The model predicts possible therapeutic treatments of Alzheimers's
Disease in terms of pharmacological manipulations of channels' kinetic
and activation properties. The results suggest how and which mechanism
can be targeted by a drug to restore the original firing
conditions. The simulations reproduce somatic membrane potential in
control conditions, when 90% of membrane is affected by AD (Fig.4A of
the paper), and after treatment (Fig.4B of the paper):

   The model predicts possible therapeutic treatments of Alzheimers's Disease in terms of pharmacological manipulations of channels' kinetic and activation properties. The results suggest how and which mechanism can be targeted by a drug to restore the original firing conditions. The simulations reproduce somatic membrane potential in control conditions, when 90% of membrane is affected by AD (Fig.4A of the paper), and after treatment (Fig.4B of the paper).

   &lt;pre&gt;This is the readme for a model that reproduces Figure 8c in:

O'Connor S., Angelo K., Jacob T.J.C. Burst firing versus synchrony in
a gap junction connected olfactory bulb mitral cell network
model. Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience 6:75.

Description:

In a network of 6 mitral cells connected by gap junctions in the
apical dendrite tuft, continuous current injections of 0.06 nA are
injected into 20 locations in the apical tuft of two of the mitral
cells. The current injection into one of the cells starts 10 ms after
the other to generate asynchronous firing in the cells (Migliore et
al. 2005 protocol). Firing of the cells is asynchronous for the first
120 ms. However after the burst firing phase is completed the firing
in all cells becomes synchronous.

This implementation is by Simon O'Connor, to whom questions should be
addressed.

Usage:
1. Unzip oconnoretal2012.zip into an empty directory.
2. Compile the mod files with (linux/unix) nrnivmodl or (mswin/mac)
mknrndll.
3. (mswin) Double click on init.hoc, or (linux/unix) execute nrngui
init.hoc from the command line or (mac) drag and drop init.hoc onto
the nrngui icon.
4. The simulation will run reproducing Figure 8c.

The files in this directory form an implementation of a BCM-like
synaptic plasticity rule in a conductance-based model. The simulation
environment is NEURON.  The model contains Na, KDR, KA and h currents,
and employs GHK-based implementations of AMPA and NMDA receptors.
Whereas the MOD files for the channel and receptor currents were
derived from previous studies, the main files associated with this
model are Fig2.hoc and Wghkampa.mod. Fig2.hoc helps recreate Fig.
2A and Fig. 2B of the following paper:

Narayanan R, Johnston D. The h current is a candidate mechanism for 
regulating the sliding modification threshold in a BCM-like synaptic 
learning rule.  J Neurophysiol. 2010 Aug; 104(2):1020-33. doi: 
10.1152/jn.01129.2009.  PubMed PMID: 20554832. PubMed Central PMCID: 
PMC2934916.

Running the functions Fig2A() and Fig2B() in the file Fig2.hoc will
create files that will contain data for plotting Fig. 2A and Fig.
2B of the paper, respectively. Example outputs that were obtained
by running Fig2A() and Fig2B() are also provided as TXT files in
this directory. A calcium-based synaptic plasticity rule (from
Shouval et al., PNAS, 2002) is incorporated into the model to update
the weight, and these weight updates are performed in the MOD file
&quot;Wghkampa.mod&quot;.

Although the BCM-like plasticity framework
has been a useful formulation to understand synaptic plasticity
and metaplasticity, a mechanism for the activity-dependent regulation
of this modification threshold has remained an open question. In this
simulation study based on CA1 pyramidal cells, we use a modification
of the calcium-dependent hypothesis proposed elsewhere and show
that a change in the hyperpolarization-activated, nonspecific-cation h
current is capable of shifting the modification threshold.

This directory contains NEURON files associated with computing
neuronal response to a Chirp stimulus. These files, and the functions
there in, could be used to generate traces that shed light on the
sensitivity of impedance measurements (both amplitude- and
phase-related) to various parameters associated with the h channel
and passive properties of a single compartmental model. These files
will help recreate results presented in Fig. 7 of the 2007 paper
and in Fig. 3 of the 2008 paper, both referenced below.

Rishikesh Narayanan and Daniel Johnston, â&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;Long-term potentiation

An example output voltage file, named &quot;ChirpGh_10.00.txt&quot;, is saved
in the Output directory.  It corresponds to default values for all
other parameters, with the h conductance set at 100 uS/cm2.  This
was generated using the &quot;Chirp_Gh()&quot; function.  The corresponding
current values are in the file &quot;ChirpI.txt&quot;. Both files contain
1002000 points, corresponding to a time period of 25050 ms, with
40 points per ms. If impedance analyses were to be performed with
values in the &quot;ChirpGh_10.00.txt&quot; file as the voltage response, and
values in the file &quot;ChirpI.txt&quot; as the current input, then the
measurements should read as follows:

Resonance frequency (f_R): 6.77 Hz 
Resonance strength (Q): 1.338
Maximal impedance amplitude (|Z|_Max): 50.9 MOhm 
Total inductive area (Phi_L): 0.0545 rad.Hz

For details about each of these measurements, refer to the two
papers mentioned above.

Computational modeling of the effects of amyloid-beta on release
probability at hippocampal synapses.

Panayiota Poirazi, Michele Migliore and Hélène Marie 
Front. Comput. Neurosci. (2013); doi: 10.3389/fncom.2013.00001 

The CA1 pyramidal model is from Bianchi et al. (2012), with the
kinetic scheme introduced by Tsodyks et al. (1998) to model changes in
release probability and synaptic integration.

Usage: Auto-launch from ModelDB or download and extract this archive,
compile the mod files (mknrndll in mswin and mac OS X, nrnivmodl in
unix/linux) in the experiment folder and use nrngui to start the
simulation.hoc file in the &quot;experiment&quot; directory.  Once started press
the &quot;Run&quot; button in the presented dialog box to reproduce the ctrl
results in Figure 2 of the paper:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=147757&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\RomaniEtAl2013\.\screenshot1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;&quot;screenshot 1&quot;&gt;

To reproduce Abeta results, set the variable U= 0.36 in the panel and
click 'Run'. You should see a graph like this:

   The role of amyloid beta (Aß) in brain function and in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease remains elusive.
Recent publications reported that an increase in Aß concentration perturbs presynaptic release in hippocampal neurons, in particular by increasing release probability of CA3-CA1 synapses. The model predics how this alteration can affect synaptic plasticity and signal integration. The results suggest that the perturbation of release probability induced by increased Aß can significantly alter the spike probability of CA1 pyramidal neurons and thus contribute to abnormal hippocampal function during Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease.Reference: Romani A, Marchetti C, Bianchi D, Leinekugel X, Poirazi P, Migliore M, Marie H (2013) Computational modeling of the effects of amyloid-beta on release probability at hippocampal synapses.  7:1

   &lt;pre&gt;Introduction:
-------------
This is the source code for the model which was used in the paper &quot;Synaptic
Scaling Balances Learning in a Spiking Model of Neocortex&quot; by Mark Rowan and
Samuel Neymotin.

To generate data for the figures in the paper, follow the instructions under
'compiling' (below) then run the relevant commands from the following list. Be
aware that some of the experiments will take a couple of days to run and will
produce large amounts of data (&amp;gt; 2GB) due to the very long amounts of time being
simulated (~44 hours).

./runsim data/trainingandscaling &quot;{stdpsim=1 scaling=1}&quot;


Creating plots:
---------------
Plots can be created using 'python plot.py &amp;lt;datadir&amp;gt; &amp;lt;plot1&amp;gt;: &amp;lt;plot2&amp;gt;'
(requires various Python packages including matplotlib, numpy, and mtspec).

e.g. to create Figure 3:
  python plot.py data/onlyscaling activity noinhib: scaling noinhib
  
or to create Figure 7:
  python plot.py data/trainingandscaling power




Compiling:
----------
Change to the 'mod' directory and run the command 'mkmod' to build the necessary
.mod files.


Running the sim:
----------------
Execute the simulation directly using ./runsim.sh [savepath] [optional args]

  where [optional args] is a list such as   &quot;{variable=value other_variable=value}&quot;
  e.g. &quot;{strdef simfilename simfilename=&quot;stdp_scaling.hoc&quot;}&quot; (which runs STDP sim)


Batch runs:
-----------
To run multiple experiments in a batch on a cluster (e.g. to get results over
various different values of activitytau), create a basic script in batchscripts
and fill in the variable name, values, and optional arguments. (See the scripts
already inside batchscripts for examples). This is currently set up to use a
GridEngine cluster, but you can edit clusterrun.sh to change cluster settings.

To execute:

  batchscripts/&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;

To run all scripts in a directory:

  run-parts batchscripts/&amp;lt;directory&amp;gt;/


Code hierarchy:
---------------
batchscripts/&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
 |_ batchcommon
   |_ clusterrun.sh
     |_ runsim.sh
       |_ sim.hoc
         |  sim setup files
         |  stdp_scaling.hoc OR alz.hoc  (chosen by setting stdpsim=1/0)

  <description>
   Learning in the brain requires complementary mechanisms: potentiation and activity-dependent homeostatic scaling. We introduce synaptic scaling to a biologically-realistic spiking model of neocortex which can learn changes in oscillatory rhythms using STDP, and show that scaling is necessary to balance both positive and negative changes in input from potentiation and atrophy. We discuss some of the issues that arise when considering synaptic scaling in such a model, and show that scaling regulates activity whilst allowing learning to remain unaltered.Reference: Rowan MS,Neymotin SA (2013) Synaptic Scaling Balances Learning in a Spiking Model of Neocortex Lect.

  <description>
   &quot; ... Our experimental results show that hypercomplexity of the apical dendritic tuft of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons affects neuronal excitability by reducing the amount of spike frequency adaptation. 

This difference in firing pattern, related to a higher dendritic complexity, was accompanied by an altered development of the afterhyperpolarization slope with successive action potentials. 

Our abstract and realistic neuronal models, which allowed manipulation of the dendritic complexity, showed similar effects on neuronal excitability and confirmed the impact of apical dendritic complexity.

Alterations of dendritic complexity, as observed in several pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases or neurodevelopmental disorders, may thus not only affect the input to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons but also shape their firing pattern and consequently alter the information processing in the cortex.&quot;Reference: van der Velden L, van Hooft JA, Chameau P (2012) Altered dendritic complexity affects firing properties of cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in mice lacking the 5-HT3A receptor  108:1521-1528

   &lt;pre&gt;This code generates figures related to the model defined in

Chadderdon GL, Neymotin SA, Kerr CC, Lytton WW (2012) 
Reinforcement learning of targeted movement in a spiking neuronal 
model of motor cortex.  PLoS ONE.

This document provides brief installation and usage instructions.

INSTALLATION

Note: the code has been designed to work on Linux machines. It may
work on Macs and will definitely not work on Windows.  This 
simulation also requires a good deal of memory to run: e.g. it will  
run on a machine with ~ 8 GB, but not one with ~ 3 GB.

Instructions:

1. Unzip all files.
2. Type &quot;nrnivmodl *.mod&quot; in the directory. This should create a
directory called either i686 or x86_64, depending on your computer's
architecture, and put a file called &quot;special&quot; in that directory.


USAGE

Run the simulation by typing &quot;nrngui sim.hoc&quot; in the directory. 
After brief initialization, a window should appear showing the arm 
moving with respect to the target X.  After this has run for a 
simulated 200 s, two more windows will be generated on top of this: 
a window showing the spiking of all of the units of the model in 
red for the first 1 s of the simulation, and another window showing 
the trajectory of the elbow joint in blue as it learns to reach for 
35 degrees.  Note that the raster plot shows 96 PR and 96 EM 
cells.  48 of each of these are related to shoulder joint activity 
of the virtual arm; the firing of these cells is not shown in the 
figures of the paper.

To run under a different learning target, you can go into arm.hoc, 
Line 66 and change the value of 'targid' to pick a different elbow 
angle target  (0 = 135, 1 = 105, 2 = 75, 3 = 35, 4 = 0 degrees).  
To choose a different learning condition, you can go to Line 54 and 
change the value of RLMode: 0 = no-learning, 1 = reward-only, 
2 = punishment only, 3 = reward-and-punishment.  The random seed for 
network wiring can be changed by going into Line 91 of network.hoc 
and setting 'dvseed' to a different value.  The random seed for the 
babbling noise can be changed by resetting the value of 'inputseed' 
in Line 13 in stim.hoc.  After resetting these parameters and 
saving the files, simulations can then be started as above.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

   These simulations examined the atrophy induced changes in electrophysiological properties of CA3 pyramidal neurons. We found these neurons change from bursting to regular spiking as atrophy increases. Region-specific atrophy induced region-specific increases in synaptic excitability in a passive dendritic tree. All dendritic compartments of an atrophied 
neuron had greater synaptic excitability and a larger voltage transfer to the soma than the control neuron.

   These are two or triple-exponential models of the voltage-dependent NMDA receptors. Conductance of these receptors increase voltage-dependently with a &quot;Hodgkin and Huxley-type&quot; gating style that is also depending on glutamate-binding. Time course of the gating of these receptors in response to glutamate are also changing voltage-dependently. Temperature sensitivity and desensitization of these receptor are also taken into account.
Three previous kinetic models that are able to simulate the voltage-dependence of the NMDARs are also imported to the NMODL. These models are not temperature sensitive. 

These models are compatible with the &quot;event delivery system&quot; of NEURON. Parameters that are reported in our paper are applicable to CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites.Reference: Moradi K, Moradi K, Ganjkhani M, Hajihasani M, Gharibzadeh S, Kaka G (2012) A fast model of voltage-dependent NMDA receptors

(2012). Sci. Reports 2:928:1-7 http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep00928


Usage:

Compile the mod files and run REDUCTION1.0.hoc for the main simulation
or MaxStimPROCEDURE1.0.hoc for the estimation of the maxstim parameter
for a specific morphology to use in REDUCTION1.0.hoc

The REDUCTION1.0.hoc simulation file allows to play with the method's
parameters (see SoftReduction1.0.doc).

Example run: After the simulation starts press the &quot;Run the Full &amp;
Reduced Models&quot; button, then select geoc70863.hoc in the morphologies
folder, the simulation will reproduce the traces in Fig.1B (left) of
the paper:

   &quot;... Here we introduce a new, automatic and fast method to map realistic neurons into equivalent reduced models running up to &gt;40 times faster while maintaining a very high accuracy of the membrane potential dynamics during synaptic inputs, and a direct link with experimental observables. The mapping of arbitrary sets of synaptic inputs, without additional fine tuning, would also allow the convenient and efficient implementation of a new generation of large-scale simulations of brain regions reproducing the biological variability observed in real neurons, with unprecedented advances to understand higher brain functions.&quot;Reference: Marasco A, Limongiello A, Migliore M (2012) Fast and accurate low-dimensional reduction of biophysically detailed neuron models  2:928:1-7

This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:
 
Orio P., Parra A., Madrid R., Belmonte C. and Viana F. (2011)
Role of the Hyperpolarization Activated Current (Ih) in the Firing
Pattern of Mammalian Cold Thermoreceptor Endings.
J Neurophysiol 108:3009-3023 (2012)
published ahead of print September 5, 2012, doi:10.1152/jn.01033.2011

This is a model for temperature-dependent bursting firing patterns,
inspired by Braun et al. (Int J Bif Chaos 8:881-889 (1998)), with
added hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) and a TREK1-like
potassium current. Also, there is a minor modification in the slow
repolarizing current.

This simulation code requires NEURON freely available from
http://www.neuron.yale.edu

How to run the model:  Auto-launch from ModelDB or
1) compile the supplied mod files
2) run or double-clic mosinit.hoc

You will be prompted to choose type of simulation and type of Ih:
1) The type of simulation
- V traces @34, 30 and 25ÂºC: This is to produce voltage traces similar
to Figures 7A and 8A.
- 6 temperature steps (ISI plot): This will run a longer simulation
(300s) with temperature steps at 34, 32, 30, 28, 26 and 24ÂºC. No
voltage trace will be plotted but instead a firing rate plot, an ISI
plot and a temperature trace.  Also a 'Save' button will be provided
that will generate a file called &quot;APdata.txt&quot;. This text file will
contain three columns: Time of spike, ISI and temperature. With this
data the Figures 7B, 8B and 10A can be generated.
- Effect of ZD (ISI plot): This will also run a 300s simulation with a
firing rate and ISI plots, similar to Figures 7C, 8C and 10B. Spike
time data can also be saved.

- Effect of ZD with v-trace: A shorter simulation with the voltage
trace while the Ih conductance is being reduced.

2) The type of Ih:
- wild type (HCN1): tau=125 ms (@25ÂºC) and V0=-85 mV. (Figure 7) For
example, after selected from the initial dialog box and &quot;Run&quot; is
pressed you should see an image similar to:
&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=141063&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\HBplusIh\fig7.png&quot; alt=&quot;fig 7&quot; /&gt;

- slow Ih (HCN2): tau=900 ms (@25ÂºC) and V0=-95mV, (Figure 8)
- slow Ih gh=0.2: tau=900 ms (@25ÂºC), V0=-95mV and gbar_ih=0.2 mS/cm2
(Figure 10)

   &quot; ... Here we investigated the role of Ih in cold-sensitive (CS) nerve endings, where cold sensory transduction actually takes place. Corneal CS nerve endings in mice show a rhythmic spiking activity at neutral skin temperature that switches to bursting mode when the temperature is lowered. 
...
Mathematical modeling shows that the firing phenotype of CS nerve endings from HCN1&amp;#8722;/&amp;#8722; mice can be reproduced by replacing HCN1 channels with the slower HCN2 channels rather than by abolishing Ih. We propose that Ih carried by HCN1 channels helps tune the frequency of the oscillation and the length of bursts underlying regular spiking in cold thermoreceptors, having important implications for neural coding of cold sensation.

These are the NEURON files for 10 different models of a reduced L5
pyramidal neuron. The parameters were obtained by automatically
fitting the models to experimental data using a multi objective
evolutionary search strategy. Details on the algorithm can be found at
www.g-node.org/emoo and in Bahl et al. (2012).

For testing: 

- Compile the channels with nrnivmodl (this model was developed under
  linux). You might then have to correct the path in reduced_model.hoc
- Test regular firing and ca-Spike examples: nrngui example1.hoc etc.
  By default the auto-launch button on ModelDB will start this file.
  After the example1.hoc is started press Init &amp; Run.  You should see:

&lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=146026&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\BahlEtAl2012\.\screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; /&gt;

- You can also load the models directly: hoc files init_models_with_ca
  are models with calcium parameters properly set, while the hoc files
  in init_models_without_ca describe models with inactivated dendritic
  calcium dynamics.

Please contact me if you have problems or questions concerning the
models or the search algorithm.

&lt;b&gt;Simulation description:&lt;/b&gt;

This is a simulation of apoptosis using a discrete/boolean network
formalism (BNET ARTIFICIAL_CELL C/NMODL code in bnet.mod). Nodes in
the network can be in one of two states (ON,OFF). Each node in the
network specifies a molecule/protein/enzyme and each rule specifies an
interaction between a set of source nodes and a single target
node. The nodes and rules are specified in text files: (names in
apopnames.txt; rules in apoprules.txt). The specification is loaded
using a python class (bnet) in bnet.py, or using the
readnames/readrules functions located there. network.py has a apopnet
class for a model of apoptosis that inherits from the bnet
class. Nodes in apopnames.txt come in a few forms: input nodes,
regular nodes, special nodes. Input nodes have the word &quot;input&quot; after
them. These nodes have fixed values for a simulation and provide input
to the rest of the network. Regular nodes (one name per line) have
their states changed based on the rules described in [1]. Special
nodes (DNADamage, Apoptosis) have their states specified based on a
special rule that integrates inputs over several iterations of the
model. Rules are specified in the following format (see apoprules.txt
for examples):

 SOURCENAMES:SOURCESTATES:WEIGHT -&gt; TARGET

SOURCENAMES are the names of source nodes and can be comma-separated
when there are multiple source nodes. SOURCESTATES are the states the
sources must be in (single or comma-separated ON,OFF). TARGET is the
target name. WEIGHT is the activation level that is changed in the
target when a rule is turned on. These rules are more fully described
in [1].

&lt;b&gt;Instructions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This simulation was tested/developed on LINUX systems, but may run on
Microsoft Windows or Mac OS.

To run, you will need the NEURON simulator (available at
http://www.neuron.yale.edu) compiled with python enabled.

Unzip the contents of the zip file to a new directory.

compile the mod files from the command line with:
 nrnivmodl *.mod

That will produce an architecture-dependent folder with a script
called special.  On 64 bit systems the folder is x86_64. To run the
simulation from the command line: 
./x86_64/special -python mosinit.py

then NEURON will start with the python interpreter and load the
mechanisms and simulation. Next, the network and inputs will be setup.
Then the simulation will run 40,000 times for 10,000 random
initializations of network state and 4 input conditions (all
combinations of TNF and GF ON/OFF).  Once the simulation has run to
completion (a few minutes on an Intel Xeon 2.27 GHz CPU), the output
will be displayed in textual format. The output measures how often the
network reaches an apoptotic state (apoptosis ratio), in each of the 4
input conditions, under the random initializations to network
state. In this model, GF represents a growth factor (pro-survival) and
TNF represents tumor necrosis factor (pro-apoptotic). The output will
have values similar to these ([1]):

 TNF: 0 GF: 0 apop ratio: 0.4733
 TNF: 0 GF: 1 apop ratio: 0.4679
 TNF: 1 GF: 0 apop ratio: 0.9715
 TNF: 1 GF: 1 apop ratio: 0.6398

&lt;b&gt;Visualization of network state:&lt;/b&gt;

The software provided makes use of the Graphviz and ImageMagick
software packages (if they are already installed) to draw the network
state over time, as an animated gif. An example of how to do this in a
simulation loop is in the myanim function in network.py . myanim also
requires a directory to store the individual frames in. This directory
should be called frames, and be present in the current working
directory. A temporary file, __junk__.dot will be written to as
well. An example rendering of a network and its state is provided
here:

 &lt;img src=&quot;.\getModelFile.asp?model=144586&amp;amp;AttrID=23&amp;amp;file=\anetdemo\.\netstate.gif&quot; alt=&quot;netstate.gif : network state&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

In this rendering, regular (special) nodes are drawn with circles
(triangles) with the name of the node indicated. Color represents node
state (off:gray, on:black).  Solid (dotted) lines represent that a
source node must be ON (OFF) to activate the rule.  Lines indicate
interaction rules (red:activating; blue:inhibiting). Thick (thin)
lines indicate a currently active (inactive) rule.

  <description>
   &quot;To understand the design principles of the molecular interaction network associated with the
irreversibility of cell apoptosis and the stability of cell surviving, we constructed a Boolean network integrating both the intrinsic and extrinsic pro-apoptotic pathways with pro-survival signal transduction pathways.
We performed statistical analyses of the dependences of cell fate on initial
states and on input signals.
The analyses reproduced the well-known pro- and anti-apoptotic effects of
key external signals and network components. We found that the external GF signal by itself did not change the apoptotic ratio from randomly chosen initial states when there is no external TNF signal, but can significantly offset apoptosis induced by the TNF signal. ...&quot;Reference: Mai Z, Liu H (2009) Boolean network-based analysis of the apoptosis network: irreversible apoptosis and stable surviving
