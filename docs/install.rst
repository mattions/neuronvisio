Requirements
============

To install Neuronvisio you need to satisfy the following dependencies

- PyQt4: http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
- matplotlib: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
- setuptools: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
- pytables: http://www.pytables.org/
- ipython: http://ipython.org 0.12 (can be automatically installed, see `Package Install`_)
- mayavi2: http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/  4.2.0 or better (can be automatically installed, see `Package Install`_)

and of course NEURON_>=7.2 compiled with python support

.. _NEURON: http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/  

Ubuntu and friends
------------------

On Ubuntu you can easily install all the requirements using apt-get with::

    sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-matplotlib python-setuptools python-tables \
                         mayavi2

If you are running a different flavour of GNU/Linux, like Fedora for example, just install 
the requirements with your package manager.

Next, see the instructions on installation of NEURON with Python available at
http://www.davison.webfactional.com/notes/installation-neuron-python/

Proceed to the `Package Install`_ .


Mac OS X
---------

Install the Homebrew package manager::

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"

Ensure your homebrewÂ installation is fully updated::

    brew update
    
and "raring to brew" (configured to Homebrew's liking) by following the instructions given by::
    
    brew doctor
    
For example, it is critical to ensure sure that you don't have another python distribution on your path (eg. Enthought), and it is also recommended that you place "/usr/local/bin" before "/usr/bin" in your PATH variable set in your "$HOME/.bash_profile" settings file.
    
Install all the homebrew packages you need, including the Homebrew version of python. NB: It is recommended by a few internet sources (eg. https://python-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/) to install python as a framework (the '--framework' option below) but it is not strictly necessary for the installation of Neuronvisio::

    brew install python --framework
    brew install qt
    brew install hdf5
    brew install vtk --python --qt --pyqt

Install python packages using pip, ensuring that you are using the Homebrew version of pip, /usr/local/bin/pip, which you should be if you put /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin in your PATH variable (this can be checked using the "which pip" command). You may also run into problems if you have setuptools in your system python ('/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages'), in this case temporarily move the system setuptools to somewhere else for the rest of the installation procedure::

    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install numexpr
    pip install cython
    pip install ipython 
    
After installing ipython you will probably want to put a link to it somewhere on your path, eg. /usr/local/bin::

    ln -s /usr/local/share/ipython /usr/local/bin/ipython
    
Next, see the instructions on installation of NEURON with Python available at
http://www.davison.webfactional.com/notes/installation-neuron-python/ (again ensuring you are using the Homebrew version of python '/usr/local/bin/python') 
    
Proceed to the `Package Install`_ .


Windows
-------

Under Windows it is recommended to get a prepackaged scientific python distribution 
which contains most of neuronvisio's dependencies, such as:

- Enthought Distribution: http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php (free for an
  academic use)
- Python(x,y): http://www.pythonxy.com/foreword.php (free)

Alternatively, if you want to do it yourself, you will need to manually install
and configure the dependencies listed in `Requirements`_

A portable and already compiled version of NEURON for Python is available 
from https://bitbucket.org/uric/pyneuron/ or simply by using::
    
    pip install PyNEURON

Proceed to the `Package Install`_ .


Package Install
===============

To install Neuronvisio we suggest to create a virtualenv and install
the packages there. Check out virtualenv_ and virtualenvwrapper_

.. _virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
.. _virtualenvwrapper: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper 

If you have `pip`_ installed and all the requirements are already met you 
can install neuronvisio from PyPi_ typing::

    pip install -U neuronvisio

.. note:: Mayavi stack and ipython will be installed automatically as Neuronvisio requirements from PyPi.

.. _PyPi: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/neuronvisio/
.. _pip: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip

Running the bleeding edge
-------------------------

If you want to run the latest code, directly from the repo, you can do it using pip::

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/neuronvisio.git#egg=neuronvisio

then you need to add the directory (the absolute path) to your PYTHONPATH (in bash)::
    
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path-to-neuronvisio-dir
    
.. _source-code-section:

Source Code
===========

The `source code`_ is on github_ at this address and git_ is used as software 
management tool

.. _source code: http://github.com/mattions/neuronvisio
.. _github: https://github.com/
.. _git: http://git-scm.com/

To install from the git just clone the repo::

    git clone git://github.com/mattions/neuronvisio.git

and then run::
    
    python setup.py install
