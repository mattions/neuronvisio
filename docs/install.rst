Requirements
============

To install Neuronvisio you need to satisfy the following dependencies

- PyQt4: http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
- matplotlib: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
- setuptools: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
- pytables: http://www.pytables.org/
- ipython: http://ipython.org 0.12 (can be automatically installed, see `Package Install`_)
- mayavi2: http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/  4.2.0 or better (can be automatically installed, see `Package Install`_)

and of course NEURON_>=7.2 compiled with python support

.. _NEURON: http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/  

Ubuntu and friends
------------------

On Ubuntu you can easily install all the requirements using apt-get with::

    sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-matplotlib python-setuptools python-tables \
                         mayavi2

If you are running a different flavour of GNU/Linux, like Fedora for example, just install 
the requirements with your package manager.

Next, see the instructions on installation of NEURON with Python availabe at
http://www.davison.webfactional.com/notes/installation-neuron-python/.

Proceed to the `Package Install`_ .


Mac OS X
---------

Install the Homebrew package manager::

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"

Ensure your homebrewÂ installation is fully updated::

    brew update
    
and "Raring to brew" (configured to Homebrew's liking) by following the instructions given by::
    
    brew doctor
    
For example, it is critical to ensure sure that you don't have another python distribution on your path (eg. Enthought), and it is also recommended that you place "/usr/local/bin" before "/usr/bin" in your PATH variable set in your "$HOME/.bash_profile" settings file.
    
Install all the homebrew packages you need, including the Homebrew version of python (NB: it is recommended by some sources, eg. https://python-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/, to install python as a framework, i.e. brew install python --framework, but this has not been tested for this procedure)::

    brew install python
    brew install qt
    brew install hdf5
    brew install vtk --python

Install python packages using pip, ensuring that you are using the Homebrew version of pip, /usr/local/bin/pip, which you should be if you put /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin in your PATH variable (this can be checked using the "which pip" command)::

    pip install numpy
    pip install ipython 
    ln -s /usr/local/share/ipython /usr/local/bin/ipython
    pip install sip 
    
Although you may need to install the sip version matching the PyQt you install manually from riverbank instead for PyQt to install.
    
Download and install PyQt from riverbank software at http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download (the pip package is broken because PyQt uses 'configure.py->qmake' instead of the regular setup tools 'setup.py' file)::

    tar -xzf PyQt-mac-gpl-4.xx.tar.gz
    cd PyQt-mac-gpl-4.xx
    python configure.py
    qmake

Next, see the instructions on installation of NEURON with Python availabe at
http://www.davison.webfactional.com/notes/installation-neuron-python/.
    
Proceed to the `Package Install`_ .


Windows
-------

Under Windows it is recommended to get a prepackaged scientific python distribution 
which contains most of neuronvisio's dependencies, such as:

- Enthought Distribution: http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php (free for an
  academic use)
- Python(x,y): http://www.pythonxy.com/foreword.php (free)

Alternatively, if you want to do it yourself, you will need to manually install
and configure the dependencies listed in `Requirements`_

A portable and already compiled version of NEURON for Python is available 
from https://bitbucket.org/uric/pyneuron/ or simply by using::
    
    pip install PyNEURON

Proceed to the `Package Install`_ .


Package Install
===============

To install Neuronvisio we suggest to create a virtualenv and install
the packages there. Check out virtualenv_ and virtualenvwrapper_

.. _virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
.. _virtualenvwrapper: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper 

If you have `pip`_ installed and all the requirements are already met you 
can install neuronvisio from PyPi_ typing::

    pip install -U neuronvisio

.. note:: Mayavi stack and ipython will be installed automatically as Neuronvisio requirements from PyPi.

.. _PyPi: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/neuronvisio/
.. _pip: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip

Running the bleeding edge
-------------------------

If you want to run the latest code, directly from the repo, you can do it using pip::

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/neuronvisio.git#egg=neuronvisio

then you need to add the directory (the absolute path) to your PYTHONPATH (in bash)::
    
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path-to-neuronvisio-dir
    
.. _source-code-section:

Source Code
===========

The `source code`_ is on github_ at this address and git_ is used as software 
management tool

.. _source code: http://github.com/mattions/neuronvisio
.. _github: https://github.com/
.. _git: http://git-scm.com/

To install from the git just clone the repo::

    git clone git://github.com/mattions/neuronvisio.git

and then run::
    
    python setup.py install
