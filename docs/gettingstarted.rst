Getting Started
***************

How does it work
================

You need to use Neuronvisio from an ipython_ console started with the qt4 thread switch::

    ipython -q4thread

.. _ipython: http://ipython.scipy.org/

To use the NeuronVisio module, after you have installed you should import with::

    from neuronvisio.controls import Controls 
    controls = Controls()   # starting the GUI

The Control class run the main loop of the application with all the GUI activities
in its own thread. The console is ready for input so you can enter your command to 
the prompt as you would do normally when using _NEURON.

.. NEURON: http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/

How to integrate NeuronVisio with your code
===========================================

The integration is rather simple and you can use either the python or the hoc 
scripts that you already have.

Python integration
------------------

If you have a model written in python, just import the module on top of your 
script. The simple example (in the example directory) give you an idea how to do 
it.

A classical template is::

    from neuronvisio.controls import Controls
    from neuron import h 
    controls = Controls()   # starting the GUI
    # Your model here

Hoc Intergration
----------------

You have to load your hoc script using the python interface of _NEURON. 
The pyramidal example gives an idea how to integrate existent _NEURON model 
with it.

A classical template is::

    from neuronvisio.controls import Controls
    from neuron import h 
    controls = Controls()   # starting the GUI
    h.load_file('path/to/my_model.hoc')

NeuronVisio features
====================

Visualization
-------------

To visualize you model after you loaded you have to click the Plot3d button.

The 3D window will open showing your model:

How to rotate
-------------

Hold the left button and move the mouse.

How to zoom
-----------

Use your mouse's wheel or the right button of the mouse.

How to move
-----------

Hold the wheel down and move the mouse.

Plotting the simulation results
===============================

Creating the vectors
--------------------

To plot the simulation's results you first have to create a Vector 
(or more than one) to record the variable that you are interested in.

For example if you are interested in the voltage you have to insert `v` 
in the 'Variable to record` and click `Create Vector`.

Run the simulation
------------------

The simulation can be run clicking on the `Init & Run` button. 
It will run until the tstop.

.. image:: images/neuronvisio_main_control.png
    
    
Plotting the simulation
-----------------------

To plot the results click on the tab 'Plots' and select the variable 
from the section you want to plot. Then click `Plot`.

If you want to plot more variables in one go hold `Ctrl` and select as 
many as you want, then click `Plot`

If you want to insert the legend just select the `legend box`

Investigate the section parameters
==================================

Select a section (Just click over it) and the section info 
will be displayed in the Sec Info Tab.

ModelDB Integration
=================
Loading a model from ModelDB
-----------------------

ModelDB database is a lightly curated repository of computational models,
published in litterature http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/. While ModelDB 
accepts models in a variety of format, a large subset is formed by models stored 
in NEURON format. The ModelDB NEURONâ€™s model are stored in an XML file, which comes with
Neuronvisio source code. The file is parsed at run time and the content is loaded
in a Qt tree widget, available in the ModelDB explorer tab, as shown in figure 2.
It is possible to browse among all the available models per year of publication,
authors, title and unique id number. The columns can be ordered alphabetically,
and a simple search using the standard regular expression search and match is
invocable using the Ctrl-F shortcut.

If available, the README associated with the model is displayed, together
with a custom model overview which summarizes the features of the model, enu-
merating the type of channels used, the cell types, the brain region, etc.

Any of the models exposed on the ModelDB explorer tab can be loaded in
Neuronvisio using the Load button. The software will fetch, extract, compile and
launch the model in the current session, giving the user the possibility to explore
and simulate the model.

Updating information from ModelDB
----------------------- 
The content of the XML file which is included with each version of neuronvisio is usually 
up-to-date with the content of ModelDB at the time of the release. Updating this file 
from the online DB can be done by manually, if required, by running from any shell the script
'src/neuronvisio/modeldb/Updater.py'. For example, on most systems you'll need to do:

    # from neuronvisio install directory
    cd src/neuronvisio/modeldb
    Uploader.py

It should be noted that the model extraction from ModelDB is slowed down to 1/sec in order
to avoid loading the site. Also this process only update the file with models which do not 
exist in the local XML file and does not currently refresh the content of existing ones.
